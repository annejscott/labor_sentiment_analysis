# **Labor Sentiment Analysis and CAD Risk Prediction**

This repository contains two data science projects exploring critical issues: labor sentiment analysis on Reddit and coronary artery disease (CAD) risk prediction using public health data. Both projects demonstrate the application of advanced machine learning techniques, statistical modeling, and impactful insights for public discourse and healthcare equity.

## **Project 1: Sentiment Analysis of Labor Discourse on Reddit**

### **Objective**  
Analyze labor-related discussions on Reddit to uncover sentiment trends and thematic clusters across ideologically diverse communities.

### **Impact & Insights**  
- Identified key sentiment trends and clusters in over 14,000 posts, revealing public attitudes towards labor issues.  
- Provided actionable insights for advocacy, highlighting key areas of contention and support in labor discourse.  

### **Methodology**  
- **Data Source**: Reddit discussions from labor-related subreddits.  
- **Techniques**:  
  - Supervised learning: Naive Bayes and fine-tuned RoBERTa transformer models for sentiment classification.  
  - Unsupervised learning: Deep Clustering by Semantic Contrastive Learning to uncover latent thematic clusters.  
- **Tools**: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, NLTK, Hugging Face).  

### **Deliverables**  
- Sentiment classification models with comparative performance metrics.  
- Visualizations of thematic clusters and sentiment trends.
