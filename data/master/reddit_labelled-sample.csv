WorkersRights,1gcagtw,men leaving the workforce a podcaster did a segment on men are leaving the workforce his criticism was all geared towards the men the common stereotype of the way men are raised being spoiled told they are good enough pampered afraid of failure lazy mamas boys etc he also states that it aint gonna fix itself my take on this is that blame cannot be placed all to one group or side there are numerous factors and things out there that are contributing to this the podcasters argument by focusing solely on mens upbringing and behavior oversimplifies a much more complex issue here are some of the key flaws with his statement economic and structural changes the economy itself has changed significantly with automation outsourcing and the decline of certain industries disproportionately affecting jobs traditionally held by men like manufacturing or construction men leaving the workforce isnt just about individual choices or attitudes but also about broader economic forces that limit opportunities in certain sectors mental health and societal pressures men face increasing mental health challenges exacerbated by societal expectations around masculinity which can make it harder for them to ask for help or seek mental health care rising rates of depression anxiety and burnout are contributing factors to men opting out of work education disparities women are now earning more college degrees than men which means that men without degrees may find it harder to compete in a job market increasingly requiring higher education this is not simply a matter of being lazy but reflects changing educational trends that impact workforce participation workplace culture in some cases toxic workplace environments and lack of support for worklife balance may discourage men from staying in the workforce especially when compared to entrepreneurial or gigeconomy options economic inequality the increasing cost of living wage stagnation and the erosion of labor rights make some jobs less attractive or sustainable especially in lowwage sectors this might cause people including men to leave the workforce out of frustration with limited upward mobility cultural shifts the expectations of what men should be doing have also shifted and many men are challenging traditional roles seeking more balance and engaging in caregiving roles or nontraditional work paths by focusing solely on stereotypes about men being lazy or spoiled the podcaster overlooks these systemic issues these flaws highlight how complex the topic is and its not a matter of individual shortcomings but the result of various overlapping factors the vast majority if not all of the viewers comments were in absolute disagreement with the podcaster it sounds like his audience recognized the oversimplification in his take when all the comments are negative its often a sign that people see through a narrow onesided analysisespecially on a topic with as many layered factors as workforce participation the disconnect likely came from him ignoring broader realities that affect everyone not just men being out of touch can happen when commentators overlook or ignore systemic issues in favor of quick blameheavy narratives the viewers pushback may also reflect a growing awareness that complex societal issues cant be chalked up to personal shortcomings alone its a good reminder that nuanced discussions tend to resonate better with audiences than ones that rely on blanket judgments also the backgrounds of this podcaster and others like him adds another layer to why viewers might find their perspective out of touch wealthy podcasters from business finance and real estate often lack firsthand experience with challenges that many workingclass men face like stagnant wages lack of upward mobility or the pressures of a changing job market when someone has achieved financial success it can be easy to overlook the systemic barriers others face unintentionally leading to overly simplistic or judgmental views their success might make them view these issues through the lens of individual effort alone rather than recognizing that access to opportunities educational background and economic shifts all play major roles this can create a disconnect between their views and the realities of many who havent had the same level of opportunity people leaving the workforce and unionization posses a threat to the wealthy at the top if the entire male and female i will bring women into this portion as well population exited the workforce even the fortunes of the wealthiest would likely take a significant hit heres how this scenario could impact the wealth and power of the top earners asset devaluation and market instability stock market collapse many of the wealthiest individuals have substantial investments in the stock market which would likely see a massive downturn as industries tied to maledominated labor sectors suffer the collapse of these sectors would ripple across the market drastically lowering the value of stocks and reducing wealth tied to these assets real estate decline real estate investments would also suffer due to reduced economic activity and rising unemployment decreased demand for both commercial and residential properties could lead to a sharp drop in property values affecting portfolios heavily invested in real estate decreased business revenues profit decline with half the workforce gone consumer demand would fall as spending power and purchasing behavior shift impacting the profitability of many businesses wealthy business owners and top earners who rely on business revenue streams would see their profits drop and valuations of privately held companies could fall as a result reduced consumer spending wealthier individuals also rely on consumer spending to drive business growth with the male workforce exiting the contraction in spending would lead to lower profits for companies in retail luxury goods hospitality and more increased pressure to fund social welfare tax policy shifts governments would likely consider emergency tax policies targeting the wealthiest to fund increased unemployment benefits welfare programs and economic stabilization efforts the ultrawealthy may face higher taxes or onetime wealth taxes to cover the cost of these programs philanthropic and social expectations with so many unemployed the public may demand greater philanthropic contributions from the wealthy to support struggling communities creating pressure on top earners to contribute more directly to social services impact on longterm wealth investment in automation some of the wealthiest individuals may benefit in the short term if they pivot toward industries related to automation ai or robotics however the transition costs would be high and the economic benefits of automation would be limited if there arent enough consumers to drive demand shrinking economic influence as their wealth declines and public sentiment shifts the political and social influence of the ultrawealthy could diminish with a weakened economy wealth alone might not carry the same clout if societal priorities shift toward supporting those hardest hit by the crisis wealth concentration could diminish increased wealth redistribution pressure the crisis could accelerate calls for wealth redistribution and stronger social safety nets while the ultrawealthy might have financial safeguards their influence over the economy could diminish as governments activists and communities push for economic reforms aimed at equity loss of monopoly power businesses dependent on workforcedependent sectors might lose significant market share or go out of business creating openings for smaller or alternative enterprises to enter the market this could shift some of the control away from monopolies or conglomerates traditionally controlled by the top in essence the fortunes of the wealthiest would be impacted by market crashes tax policy changes and shifts in economic power structures although some of the ultrawealthy might adapt by investing in alternative technologies even they would face challenges maintaining their wealth and influence in a reshaped crisisdriven economy a mass exodus of men from the workforce could indeed trigger significant changes and while it would create substantial shortterm disruptions it could also have unexpected benefits in the longer term heres a breakdown of how it could potentially be beneficial catalyst for labor reform higher wages and better conditions a severe labor shortage would force companies to offer more competitive wages better benefits and improved working conditions to attract and retain workers this could lead to a healthier labor market for everyone where workers have more power and choice unionization gains with a noticeable gap in the workforce the value of organized labor could be highlighted giving rise to greater support for unions and collective bargaining particularly in industries hit hardest by the exodus accelerated shift to worklife balance rethinking traditional work structures with a major segment of the workforce gone companies would likely be pressured to adopt more flexible work models like hybrid or remote work better benefits for family life and policies that promote mental health this could promote a shift away from the rigid highstress work models that dominate many industries increased awareness of gender roles the absence of men in the workforce might encourage a reevaluation of gender roles possibly leading to more balanced family dynamics where caregiving and professional work are more equally distributed between men and women focus on automation and innovation investment in automation to counteract the labor shortage companies might invest heavily in automation ai and other technologies which could lead to more efficient processes while this could displace some jobs it might also create new roles in tech and maintenance pushing the workforce toward a knowledge and service economy innovation in industries to manage with fewer workers companies would need to innovate possibly creating new systems workflows and technologies that make jobs easier safer and less laborintensive this innovation cycle could open up different job opportunities and industries in the long run push for a universal basic income ubi safety net support the mass departure of men from work might make a compelling case for ubi or similar programs to support those opting out of traditional employment this could promote economic stability allow people more freedom to pursue creative or entrepreneurial projects and support those in caregiving roles or with health challenges shift in economic models the emphasis on ubi could lead to an economic model less dependent on traditional labor where income isnt exclusively tied to employment this could reduce poverty promote more equitable wealth distribution and encourage a greater focus on personal fulfillment cultural shift in the value of work redefining success and contribution with fewer men in traditional roles society might start to value other forms of contribution outside of the workforce such as community involvement creative pursuits or volunteer work this shift could lead to a culture that values diverse forms of achievement and wellbeing over purely financial or career success improved health and wellbeing for individuals stepping away from a highstress job could offer health benefits with less chronic stress more time for physical activity and better mental wellbeing this shift in lifestyle could have a positive ripple effect on public health and healthcare costs environmental impact lower carbon footprint fewer people commuting combined with a potential shift to automation could lead to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions this reduction would be particularly noticeable if industries adapted to use more sustainable practices in response to the labor gap shift in consumption patterns as people adjust to new lifestyles there could be a move toward sustainable consumption patterns such as supporting local businesses reducing waste and promoting ecofriendly products and services in summary while a mass exodus of men would initially cause economic and social disruptions it could also push society toward a more balanced flexible and sustainable future the changes could encourage innovation elevate labor rights drive policy shifts and redefine success in the long term such a shift might balance economic power provide greater freedom and improve quality of lifebenefiting individuals and society as a whole,0,2024,10,25,neutral

Teachers,1h0984e,not to try and shit on your horrible situation but heres the other side of the coin it sounds like your administration is in the wrong but it also helps to know how they process these decisions first any good performance under another contract at another district is completely irrelevant the administration have no record of that performance they want no access to those old records they dont need to follow the evidence because they only require to evaluate you based on the performance of this contract if you started the district this year and youve had performance errors now and months to remedy them theyre going to see it as a xx teacher is unfit for the classroom and is uncoach able second they almost certainly have a probationary clause that means they can terminate with cause without much due process tenured staff have to show consistently bad behavior but a new teacher can be let go with one bad evaluation this a bigger problem in a nonunion district as unions tend to go beyond the federal minimums and demand due process even for their new teachers however even in a union district they can say due process was provided by documenting something as slim as a conversation between your admin and you in which you were told to improve your performance if at any point in the last three months your needs have been brought to your attention then they have due process then its simply the admins job to show you didnt meet the expectations third if the specific reason for any of the improvement was not related to clearly described symptom expression then they have no accountability for disability protection employees must notify hr of a disability the administration cant simply assume you have a disability or what the symptoms of it are here are some counter points to the three above though under the first point if you have had any documented praise then it does justify their disconnected feedback it can be hard to be coachable if one coach says youre doing great and another says youre fucking up just remember to use feedback only from administrators of this district not another one even showing verbal praise is acceptable because the point is to simply to express that their inconsistent feedback makes it impossible to show improvement under the second point all due process should be in writing if it wasnt written it wasnt feedback your dismissal may be much more thin if you havent received an email discipline file entry or letter that shows you what lack of improvement you have committed also be wary of approving their observation as fact an admin is trained to ask questions like is all of this right or do you agree with these observations if you ever check the yes box youre fucked because it means they dont have to procure evidence for their observations if you disagree or decline to provide assent they at least have to cover their findings with documented evidence go back to the eval with all bad scores and tell the administrator that youd like to review the findings then when they review them make sure a clear remark is made from your own writing that explains to the administrator that you do not agree with the findings if you do this it is critical that you ask for union or lawyer assistance the union isnt a sign of bad faith but the lawyer would be seen badly but may be necessary you can ask for assistance on any grounds but its likely your boss would see it more graciously if you explain its because you have autism and want the support to make sure you understand the situation clearly also for the point above very importantly if you did provide assent in past scenarios send a clearly worded email to the admin and explain that you are no longer agreeing with the findings and retract the agreement you can make this tone sound innocuous dear supervisor i have thought more about the evaluation and appreciate your time spend giving me feedback however i have thought about it further and realize that i would not agree with the findings please remove the remark i made supporting the findings i will be happy to set aside time to discuss this further if needed send that to only the supervisor but then forward the email to the hr director and explain in an innocent way hi i sent this to my supervisor and want to look at my evaluation file to change some of my answers but im new to the software can you help me with this under the third point there are two things you must do first is show everything about your diagnosis to hr now or as soon as you can related to disability accommodation request at the bare minimum your employee file should note the disability and your active interest in receiving district support also under this note harassment is harassment and doesnt require hr forms to justify you were harassed at the school online and likely under the clear watchful eyes of the administrators this gives you leverage in a wrongful termination because their duty to protect you from harassment and workplace hazards is guaranteed by osha outside of disability support this is the biggest reason to lawyer up they can explain to the hr and possibly a judge that your harassment was the cause for the issues you experienced and that your rightful compensation ought to be honored as the lack of safety at the workplace is their responsibility thats complex and legally tricky but find a good lawyer and go to town on the hr department,2,2024,11,26,positive

Teachers,1h5b12r,so sorry this happened in my experience new admins sometimes come in with an agenda and an attitude that theyre going to clean house so they have something to prove with their rigorous observations i had something similar happen to me in my second or third year of teaching years ago my lesson that they observed was good but the principal added in a remark that she got from the assistant principal a student had complained to him about me a few months before because she was upset that i told her to stop interrupting the class by handing out gum to everybody she complained that i was disrespectful because when she was working in a group of high performing students i jokingly said and how are you slackers doing over here anyway i signed the observation but i shouldnt have i went back to the principal and brought up the fact that i thought it was a little unfair to include a secondhand comment from something that happened earlier in the year and had nothing to do with my lesson the union was strong in that school so the principal took it off my observation even though i had already signed it,5,2024,12,3,neutral

Teachers,1h13bwt,yep i was an intelligent but lazy student who preferred reading scififantasy and video games to academics i grew up in a medium socioeconomic area and went to school there but moved in middle school to a lower socioeconomic area but continued to go to school in my home district on a permit once i got into high school my work ethic earned me ds almost across the board because i never did homework which was graded heavier than class work or quizzestests so i was kicked out and went to a high school closer to my home there i immediately made honor roll and the deans list not because i applied myself more but because the level of expectations on students was so much lower things i was supposed to be learning in this district at grade level were either things i already learned in middle school at the old district or was just so basic that i was never challenged i felt genuine sympathy for the kids around me who marveled at how smart i was because i knew i wasnt i became disillusioned with school seeing the disparity in educational standards between the two districts it wasnt the teachers or the curriculum that necessarily held things back it was the general apathy of students and the priority they placed on school my family life fell apart junior year and i had a few great mentor teachers who helped guide me through the chaos of my life i always enjoyed reading and writing and i felt literacy was key to a successful life i always had an idea in the back of my head that i would like to be someone who could give the kids i went to school with a fighting chance in the world and be that same mentor for kids who were drowning in chaos and needed a guiding hand i didnt know what i wanted to do when i graduated but was forced by my family to go to a junior college to give myself time to consider my major i was already working at the time and living on my own so i went part time to school while working full time but my heart really wasnt in it because i felt directionless i had a gpa and a bunch of faileddropped classes eventually i dropped out and joined a union working construction for a years or two and realized how miserable i was doing something i had no passion or fulfillment for it was then that it finally clicked in my head that i wanted to go into teaching english and i went back to the jc and earned my necessary credits in order to transfer to a state school i had averaged over a after i returned to school but my cumulative gpa was luckily i was accepted into a state college with an english education focus i earned a gpa in my undergrad because i finally cared enough and knew the miserable life i had waiting for me should i fail ive been teaching for years and even though the job isnt perfect and ive got tons to gripe about i still wouldnt want to be doing anything else with my life,2,2024,11,27,neutral

WorkersRights,1gw3k4r,no double time policy im not sure if this is the right place to ask but i figured if anyone would know the answer itd be someone in a union my company recently changed our weekend overtime policy now to qualify for double time or timeandahalf on weekends were required to have already worked hours on the specific job being worked over the weekend for example if i work hours on job a during the week then come in for mandatory weekend shifts which happen every weekend on job a i would get overtime the problem is this setup is almost impossible during any given week i work on different jobs averaging about hours on each my question is is this some kind of legal loophole or is it flatout illegal everyone tells me this is illegal as hell but the company has been doing this since may and plans to continue until next may for context im a pretty skilled worker but i dont have certifications for about of the work i do on a daily basis switching companies would be difficult but if this policy is as shady as it seems it might be the last straw for me,8,2024,11,20,positive

Teachers,1h2o82r,so it sounds like youre inheriting someone elses class midyear one of the worstcase scenarios for a teacher this means you have no idea the structure the last teacher has in place all the students know each other and likely have a bond in some way that can only strengthen their opposition to you and expectations from admin are going to be high since your impact will be more apparent than other teachers it can be a death trap if you dont know what youre doing my only suggestion is to start from absolute scratch like its day one get in that room today if you can tomorrow at the latest and change shit up as much as possible seating arrangements decor lighting whatever you can do to make it your room to make it vastly different than the last teacher get your roster and create a fresh new assigned seating arrangement hopefully you can do enough recon to at least get an idea of which students are the most disruptive and seat them accordingly tape numbers to each deskseat and assign a number to each student write each number down on its own index card with a large bold sharpie now you have an organized list of your students placements and can record seat numbers instead of of full names for later until you learn all names on monday meet your students at the door and do not let anyone go inside until youve introduced yourself and explained that you will hand each one a card and they are to walk in to class find their seat and sit quietly until the entire class is seated and you are ready to begin instruction now obviously not every student is going to follow suit but that is the test once the last student enters you assess the situation let the class know that was their first test to give you an idea of how well they follow directions and how long these assigned seats will remain record seat numbers of students not following directions you can look up names later ask each student to write down on their index card the best phone number to reach their parentsguardians even though you technically have access to this info this is a much faster and easier way of confirming contact information for parents let them know if they dont know the number its ok just write down their parentsguardians names keep in mind students are going to absolutely hate this they will moan and groan and hate you on your first day good they will learn to love you and your system over time nowhere to go but up that same evening call parentsguardians it sucks and it takes time but hopefully you will only have to do it once introduce yourself and let them know if they need anything to call you try to keep the call positive and only briefly mention their kid had trouble following directions but well get on track by years end news will get back to the kid that they spoke to you now the kids know you have their parents number and will use it from this point on when a student is getting out of line pull their card and ask them if that is the correct number to reach their parentguardian if this doesnt strike fear in them nothing will now all of this is obviously best done on the first day of school but you dont have that option its still imo the most effective way of mitigating damage and setting yourself up for long term success on day no matter what remember it is your classroom not theirs establish that on day and make sure everyone is on that page if not they will make it their classroom and youll never get it back doesnt even matter the age group youll probably hear other teachers chime in with its supposed to be our classroom not your classroom fuck all that if you want to remain in this line of work for any type of longevity you will need to find a way to make work easy and completely separate your personal life from work life best way to do that is set strict guidelines and norms that make classroom management a breeze and allows you to actually teach good luck youre gonna need it,1,2024,11,30,neutral

Labor,1f6coij,neither of those statements are true dems have nothing to do with the existence of unions and unions will continue to exist even if trump wins,11,2024,9,1,neutral
Labor,1f6coij,labor unions built the middle class and democrats built the unions trumps conservative manifesto project is comprised of hundreds of pages that will rescind civil rights and limit all our government protection and one of the most insidious provisions of this document is to completely eliminate overtime pay for hourly workers overtime is now predicated on a forty hour work week under project that will change to a one hundred sixty hour work month it sounds the same but here is where the villainy creeps in if a worker puts in five extra hours of overtime for three weeks the boss has only to cut his hours in the fourth month to twentyfive hours thus assuring he still works one hundred sixty hours but is not entitled to overtime pay i told you it was insidious the right to overtime pay was won in but that is far from all the improvements unions secured for americans minimum wage was a union achievement as were child labor laws paid vacations sick leave healthcare benefits anti discrimination laws and the right to strike were all won through the support of and encouragement democrat administrations and against the opposition of the gop all this will change under a republican administration a heartless trump administration and once those gains are lost they will never be recovered see this boldface mine workers rights won by unions from the hour workday to overtime pay workers at american companies and institutions of higher learning are making headlines for strikes and unionizing efforts among employees including amazon starbucks rutgers university harpercollins and hollywood writers amid this socalled union boom labor unions are seeing their highest approval ratings since the s with gen z showing up as americas most prounion generation in recent history so its no wonder people are curious about what a union can do for them the overall proportion of unionized workers in the united states remains relatively low with only one in every workers in the country belonging to a union but whether youre a union worker or not you may benefit from policies for which unions have fought long and hard and they continue to fight labor organizing has helped secure everyday benefits that many of us now take for granted and these efforts have shown people what kind of protections they can hope to secure in the workplace lets take a look at examples an eighthour workday twoday weekend and overtime pay most of us probably take the standard fiveday workweek eighthour workday and twoday weekend structure as a given when were asked to work more than this we may even feel like our rights and livelihood are being infringed upon of course many workers take on the extra work anyway the details of this standard schedule are the result of decades of activism first in the federation of organized trades and labor unions passed a resolution that the workday be limited to eight hours as kim kelly has written for teen vogue thanks to robust labor organizing including strikes by the carpenters union and united mine workers of america the fair labor act flsa was finally enacted in among other provisions the flsa established a fiveday workweek thereby creating a twoday weekend in thanks in part to a previously recognized demand from the amalgamated clothing workers of america congress amended the flsa to officially create a hour workweek a minimum wage new zealand was the first country to mandate a minimum wage in the united states didnt follow suit until more than years later women and organizations against child labor had actively campaigned for a minimum wage for those groups since the early s arguing that children were often doing similar work to adults but were paid much lower wages by according to the atlantic states and washington dc passed laws enshrining minimumwage protections specifically for women and children but it wasnt until the late s that this also applied to men and nonunionized workers angered by the unjust wages and layoffs during the great depression unemployed and union workers fought for fairer wages and the flsa was enacted to support fdrs new deal child labor laws recently lawmakers have weakened state child labor laws across the country these regulatory moves are undoing social welfare legislation that has benefited the health and wellbeing of american workers in almost of all american workers were under these children were primarily from lowerincome families and often worked hours or more six days a week in harsh and sometimes hazardous conditions as with the minimum wage federal child labor laws were catalyzed by the great depression though in prior decades there had been an especially strong push by women and labor unions for legislative bodies to pass legislation protecting children the flsa eventually set very specific limits on how many hours children could work outside of school though agricultural work is still done under an entirely different set of rules which has generated controversy paid vacation and holidays in the wake of the great depression unions started to push for paid time off which they negotiated with employers this effort set a standard for twoweeks paid vacation that extended to many nonunion workers as well in the s however as unions lost popularity and influence the european union and other countries started to outpace the united states in requiring paid time off for workers in the center for economic and policy research released a study that found an estimated one in four us workers has no paid time off or paid vacation days whatsoever the united states is alone among the member countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in lacking a national vacation policy or mandated paid holidays join a union though and your chances of getting paid vacation increase profoundly a book from the economic policy institute epi found that after years unionized employees get nearly more vacation weeks than their nonunionized counterparts according to the department of labor these benefits are especially helpful for women particularly women of color those who belong to unions have greater access to paid time off and paid vacation sick leave as with holidays and paid time off union workers are more likely to have sick leave than nonunion workers according to the epi an estimated of union workers have access to paid sick leave while only of nonunion workers enjoy that benefit coming out of the pandemic paid sick leave has become a hot topic of discussion among employees and employers why is paid sick leave so beneficial it reduces the spread of illness with some research estimating that guaranteed paid sick leave would decrease flu rates by at least in addition the reduced stress can help a person get better faster worker health care if youre part of a union you probably enjoy better health care coverage than workers who arent unionized as of twothirds of nonunion workers had health care compared with of union workers according to epi why is this theres a long tradition of unions advocating for health care benefits stretching back to the industrial revolution as unions gained in popularity they made efforts to ensure that their workers would continue to get paid despite sickness or injury although some union leaders initially opposed state health care because they believed it would decrease dependence on unions they later fought for social security in and medicare in and they continue to advocate for better health care for their workers today antidiscrimination protections unions and women workers were at the helm of the equal pay act signed by president john f kennedy in prohibiting sexbased wage discrimination for women doing the same job as men regarding race though unions havent always been on the same page historically some unions sought to exclude certain racial and ethnic groups while others sought to protect them however by the era of the civil rights movement unions started to play a larger role in the fight for racial justice through mobilizing members and political lobbying the civil rights act of and the voting rights act of both codified laws against racial discrimination and were won in part thanks to political lobbying and support by the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organization or aflcio now the largest federation of unions in the united states today labor unions continue to help people fight workplace discrimination right to strike strikes are one of the most visible actions in which unionized workers engage with university employees los angeles teachers hollywood tv writers and more recently taking to the picket lines strikes can help workers win greater protections and benefits higher pay or fairer wages for centuries workers have gone on strike for better working conditions but the actual right to strike is protected thanks to labor unions the national labor relations act of also called the wagner act protects the right to strike and outlines guidelines by which strikes are deemed lawful strikes provide workers with necessary bargaining power to improve working conditions and pay safety regulations or workers comp unions help ensure that members receive workers compensation should they become injured on the job but union insistence on the strict adherence to safety practices has also helped decrease the need for this provision workers compensation is an especially critical issue for union workers some of whom work in highrisk jobs because injuries can result in a long leave and extra expenses workers comp often helps cover medical expenses not just wages unions also help address this issue by offering supplemental benefits such as cash stipends or disability benefits that nonunion workers dont often get some labor unions fought specifically for largescale workers comp that directly related to issues stemming from the hazards of their particular occupation a wellknown example is the black lung benefits act of which was adopted thanks united mine workers a miners union and provides compensation to miners disabled by black lung disease pneumoconiosis protecting public education schooling and education may not be the first things that come to mind when you hear the word union but our public education system and the protections and benefits afforded to teachers owe a lot to unions after the national education associations nea founding in the union took a variety of progressive stances and later focused on a multitude of issues such as raising teacher salaries ending child labor educating emancipated enslaved persons and helping indigenous children subject to forced assimilation as the hechinger report documents the american federation of teachers or aft founded in went on to fight for equal pay for women teachers while the nea fought for the racial integration of schools and to improve education for black students

Ask_Politics,1fjvpp4,there is a vein of absolutist thinking in this question that just doesnt quite make any sense to me when we talk about defining a political ideology who is defining it it almost seems like you feel the labels that we use to describe a society has some sort of inherent value more than the things we can observe in the society in other words you seem to value the label as some sort of predictor rather than just a description that is applied in retrospect really i wouldnt even say that having a political ideology is all that important sure during the cold war that was a whole thing but for the most part the lesson weve learned from that is that having a worldview where the entire world is put into distinguishing ideological camps is both useless and misguided in reality we can say the soviet union wasnt socialist because the things that the socialists were trying to achieve were never actually achievedin their own words thats not western ex post facto analysis especially in the middle years when the soviet union was at its peak the premiers were constantly wrestling with why their communist utopia wasnt yet achieved it was the chief domestic challenge that they faced for most of the cold war but thats exactly the point the fact that they were more wrapped up in the details of how to achieve a certain ideological outcome rather than focusing on real policy concerns and how to directly address them is one of the main reasons the soviet union was unable to survive as a viable political entity understanding political questions through the lens of ideology is a fools errand,1,2024,9,23,neutral

liberal,1dwneh4,misconceptions about the supreme courts immunity ruling im seeing a lot of misconceptions and bad information on reddit about the supreme courts presidential immunity ruling us v trump i want to clear it up to keep the conversations on track and help people understand the claims being made about it if it matters ive been a practicing litigation attorney for over years and focus on representing governmental entities the appeal came from trumps indictment for conspiring to overturn the election his lawyers tried to dismiss the case saying that presidents cant be prosecuted for anything at least until after being impeached and convicted by congress the lower courts rejected that argument all nine supreme court justices also rejected that argument but six of them gave trump even more than he asked for instead they held that his immunity from prosecution is automatic but tiered if the president is exercising powers given solely to him in the constitution like controlling the military and foreign affairs the immunity is absolute if instead the president is doing anything else as long as its not clearly outside his powers the immunity is presumptive rather than absolute that means the immunity can be overcome if prosecutors persuade a court on a casebycase basis that applying a criminal prohibition wouldnt intrude on executive authority importantly the court said its not the actions illegality or the presidents motives that matter for that question just whether holding him to the criminal law would impede his powers the third tier is unofficial acts which have literally no connection to his job at all and so get no immunity if the immunity does apply either absolutely or presumptively it means not only that criminal charges cant be brought but that the official act cant even be mentioned in a trial on whatever nonimmune acts remain justice barrett disagreed with this last part but a majority still made it law the supreme court said trumps conversations with at least some federal officers about overturning the election would definitely be absolutely immune but sent the litigation back to the lower courts to sort out which tier of immunity might apply to the rest of his conduct the ruling is extraordinary for many reasons first nothing in the constitution says anything like this and the evidence strongly suggests that was deliberate second it dramatically exceeds the immunity all other government officials get most immunity is qualified meaning that its conditioned on the officials good faith reasonableness or similar limits this is the first time in american history a person has ever been given nearly complete license to break every law third prohibiting even the mention of official acts in any court case is not only unheard of but totally unworkable as four of the justices noted it means a prosecution against a president for taking a bribe couldnt tell the jury what he agreed to do in exchange so when people defend this ruling by saying officials have always had this immunity theyre totally wrong this ruling goes far beyond any kind of immunity thats ever existed also when people defend the official acts requirement by saying crime isnt an official act theyre ignoring what the ruling said the court specifically held that the alleged crime isnt the official act that matters but rather the kind of government function the president was operating within when he committed it for example if he accepted a bribe to sign a law the bribe is the crime hes immune from the official act which triggers his immunity is signing legislation which the constitution says is one of his core powers on the flipside the ruling does not give the president any new powers so when people say biden should use this ruling to replace the justices or to ban felons from being president this ruling says nothing like that it doesnt put him above the law by giving him all government powers it puts him above the law by saying when he uses his existing powers he can commit any crime related to them for example if biden ordered the justices arrested it would just mean biden couldnt be prosecuted for having given that illegal order it wouldnt mean the arrests themselves would hold up in court but ironically if biden or any president ordered the military to assassinate the justices the ruling would appear to mean he couldnt be prosecuted for it since commanding the military is one of his core constitutional powers and the motive and illegality of the order itself are also covered by absolute immunity a president could literally announce in his state of the union address that he will sell pardons to the highest bidder and neither the speech nor the pardons could ever be mentioned to a jury in a prosecution against him this supreme court ruling is considered ridiculous and dangerous in nearly all legal circles it really does put one person above the law and that person commands a nuclear arsenal its

Ask_Politics,1fjvpp4,how is societys political ideology defined first define political ideology what you consider political ideology is most likely not political ideology nor implemented but go ahead lets see once you try to define it or give an example of what you mean we can begin to correct it is a given implemented ideology truly what it says it to be even if it contains contradictions or is it disqualified as truly being that said ideology because of those contradictions or do you think the only reason it would be disqualified would be because of something systemic in politics and many of the social sciences there are no rigid systems for validating what concepts are valid or invalid based on things like logic consistency etc so ideologies that are adopted are adopted mostly based on popularity and for that reason yes popular ideologies may contain contradictions within itself and with other ideologies contradictions usually dont disqualify a concept or ideology as i said its based on popularity if contradictions occur most people would not even open their eyes to those contradictions or accept it if its from a popular author we simply label the topic with its complicated instead of using that as a basis for recognizing the flaw in the concept which is probably widely adopted and discarding or questioning it to improve it if attempts are made to improve the concept it often happens by patch work for instance add another condition to the concept to make it whole and keep adding new conditions when new contradictions emerge eventually they may break the concept apart to create various forms of the concept thats how contradictions are resolved a good example is the simple concept of democracy it has been subjected to that very treatment over the years and yeah most social scientists would come after me for all those remarks like for example its not that the soviet union wasnt socialist because it sold pepsi and other capitalist products but rather it wasnt socialist because the workers didnt own the means of production i dont understand what you are trying to say here but socialism is not a political ideology i know most scholars will tell you it is its the result of erroneous literature due to the problem i have just hinted at above,2,2024,9,18,neutral

Libertarian,1gh4u5q,it is likely a variation of syndicalism it is a popular form of socialism syndicalism is interchangeable with the term corporatism syndicalism is a idea that society and the economy should be divided up into corporations also called syndicates that represent the workersproducers of that particular segment of the economysociety most typically these are a form of unions workerowned corporations they typically elect representatives that run their respective corporationssyndicates and then those committees send representatives to the central state which coordinates economic action of the entire nationregionetc there are lots of variations on this central theme some are more marxist then others some are more nationalistic some are more business oriented others are more centralized its proponents often market it as a third way or new way between full blown marxism and traditional society they also like to promote private public partnerships in which capitalism is harnessed by the state like a work animal it sometimes is seen as more traditional and often got promoted by religious authorities i suspect it gets promoted sometimes as a way to take the wind out of the sails of revolutionary marxism that is it intended to provide the socialism and social protections that is promised without the revolutionary bloodshed italian fascism was a popular form of syndicalism in the s it derives its name from fascii which was a popular italian term for workers union or workeroriented political groups that fought for worker rights in the late th century this follows the typical corporatist model mussolini tried to divide up the country into major corporations that represented different important aspects of italian society like educators and students corporation religious corporation etc it was a totalitarian ideology as are almost all socialist ones which meant that there was no separation of state from the people under fascist theory a individual is weak and subject whims of fate were as a individual who is incorporated into a state is like a single private soldier in a military they are weak and ineffective individually and are only strong while united under together into a army thus individuals can only be fully realized through the state only then they are free to live out their lives to their fullest potential while the state takes care of all the details of things like businesseconomics food housing healthcare retirement etc hence the phrase everything within the state nothing outside the state nothing against the state it was claimed as the ultimate form of democracy not because of elections but because democracy was government of the people and the fascist state there is no separation the state is literally allencompassing the state is the people there are a supreme council in his ideal world contemplate this council consist of a group of people who learned and examined all of human accumulation including of philosophical ideas historical events and technological developments etc this is a very old idea in western civilization and harkens back to platos republic and its ideas of philosopher kings under platos model it is a sort of caste system in which people are divided up into various social strata by inheritable traits they are kept in their respective castes with the bulk of them being simple workers sexuality education and information is kept tightly controlled to keep people in their place and reduce social friction at the top of this model are the philosopher kings people bred conditioned and educated for their entire lives to rule and keep society working although your friends idea sounds more like a people divided by profession instead of breeding which is a much more modernist way of seeing things which tends to emphasis conditioning and social forces much more then natural differences between people so it isnt exactly the same but it is close central committee is a common socialist idea soviet russia gets its name from soviet which is a russian term for committee rule through trained professional class is almost a given marxism believes the once the state the proletariats state is totally in control it will construct a materialsocial structure that will recreate man in so that they are fundamentally socialist in nature totally eliminate all forms of individuality at that point mans nature will be in line with always favoring the greater good and thus the state would become unnecessary that is the state nullifies itself however other socialist models this isnt always the case your friend sounds like he believes there is a need for a permanent professional elite class necessary to direct all human action this model of government doesnt work because no matter how much training or education a elite may acquire they are only going to be marginally more competent then the average person which means that they are barely qualified to run their own lives much less run the lives of millions of other people also economy and society is a chaotic system meaning it defies calculation and prediction in order to make a central planning committee work they must posses almost perfect knowledge of what is going on in society at any given point in time and must be fed continuous updates this is not possible even with massive computer networks and ai it doesnt work society works as a distributed system with each individual or small group of people acting autonomously and reacting to feedback loops they dont need nearly perfect knowledge of everything they just need very good knowledge of the things under their control and the ability to react to changing circumstances quickly under a distributed system failures are very common and people make the same mistakes over and over again but the mistakes and failures are isolated to their respective nodes and the impact is mostly to the people involved in making decisions this creates a very flexible and adaptive system were as under central planning knowledge of failures are incorporated into bureaucratic systems and thus lessons learned become encoded into the administrative law of the central bureaucracy this means that failures happen far less often but it also mean that it is not able to change or adapt to changes in the world also it means that failures are far more cataclysmic and that bad decision makers are isolated from the consequences of their bad decisions for example a bankruptcy of a business may directly impact hundreds or thousands of people bankruptcy of a entire country will impact millions or even billions of people failure of a restaurant or farm or store to provide food for its people results in the business failing failure of a central totalitarian government to provide food for its people results in the starvation and suffering of millions also the primary focus of large bureaucracies quickly transforms from its intended purpose to focusing on its own survival and growth without having a external system to keep it in check then the long term consequences of allowing such a system to control everything is cataclysmic,2,2024,10,29,neutral

union,1gn9oal,i was in a union position until earlier this year and heavily involved in organizing and administrationinternal bureaucracy it was so much harder during the trump era because we couldnt go to the nlrb and expect to win i was at a university and there was concern that if we did they might strike down the ruling that enabled us to form in the first place progress was way easier under biden the one thing that the trump era did was make things bad enough that we were able to get a strong yes vote to form vs close to before his election basically our membership became substantially more prounion over that time span and while some of that is probably our organizing it was also true for new employees so hopefully that part at least will continue,8,2024,11,9,positive

Ask_Politics,1fc8rsv,lol did you actually read the article you linked from the article the viennabased iaea reported earlier this monthhttpsapnewscomarticleiranuraniumenrichmentiaeaustensionsafaaeadc that iran had slowed the pace at which it is enriching uranium to nearly weaponsgrade levels that was seen as a sign that tehran was trying to ease tensions after years of strain between it and the us thenpresident donald trump unilaterally pulled the us out of the accord in restoring crippling sanctions iran began breaking the terms a year later formal talks in vienna to try to restart the deal collapsed in august httpsapnewscomarticlerussiaukraineirandubainuclearmiddleeastceeffbcfcbeacf as i said your timeline is off this article was written in years after trump pulled out of the deal all credible information suggests iran was complying with the deal when trump pulled out of it and then continued to do so out of good faith for a year it was only after trump called off the deal and then continued to antagonize iran that it started breaking the terms of the deal it was no longer held to trump threatened to pull out of nato as a negotiation tactic and it worked many allies raised the percentage of gdp they allocated to defense ok so trump did suggest pulling out of nato look at that and it worked to get them to pay more but it also undermined our nato alliances and that is arguably a very very very poor outcome that far outweighs what trump think he accomplished if you think iran is our friend you do not know anything about it lol i promise you i know more about the history of our foreign policy in the middle east than you do the point is the iran deal was part of the process of moving them out of enemy status they werent exactly allies at that point but the needle was shifting until trump did everything he could to push it back and get it stuck in that position and for the record sending someone billions of dollars overnight is called foreign aid and thats how it works you can literally say thats exactly the same relationship we have with israel and quite frankly even with us sending them absurd amounts of money they still find a way to challenge us quite a bit irans proxies have attacked our troops in the middle east over xs weve responded weakly xs weakness ok so are you saying that war with iran is a desirable foreign policy what a moron the only way to deal with iran is through strength appeasement only encourages the terror they sponsor actually because relations with iran have been warming theyve way cut down on their terror attacks thats the point our relations are warming and war or terror strikes with iran less like than theyve been since the fall of the shah thats great thats exactly how we know the obamastyle approach works and sure trump did have sanctions on russia but he also undermined those sanctions look at the one that sanctioned groups for the election interference well he also straight up asked russia to interfere in our elections so thats at best a mixed message that sort of stuff was what we saw with trump all the time bidenharris removed many of them russia invaded ukraine during obama and during biden administrations funny how they didnt invade anyone when trump was in office yeah because trump was helping putin take ukrainian territory without the need for an invasion putin invaded because biden and obama actually stood up to him this isnt my characterization its literally something russia has said itself youre deluded guy,2,2024,8,30,neutral

Teachers,1gwj6sr,my state is the same for teachers and state workers we absolutely need a union i realize that in comparison southern states dont have the same cost of living as california and therefore the salaries are lower but my state has literally been in crisis mode for at least a decade now bc the state salaries are so low that even agency director positions go unfilled from middle on down youre looking at needing a second job even with full time status teacher salaries are loooow especially for newbies our agency it departments are in absolute shambles that includes everything from the dmv to all levels of education institutions we cant attract top talent for really important things like infrastructure and development management which is appalling since we are on the coast facing climate change and bigger storms we cant enforce development or building codes at the level we need to we cant keep good people you cannot stay in a position youre good at that you love and are dedicated to because you will never get more than a col raise no matter your accolades or increased responsibility so what if you get more training or an advanced degree to do your job even better with salary compression and painfully low salaries that leads to people leaving within a few years bc the salaries are so painfully behind we also cant institute really good standards for positions because we have a hard time getting better than warm bodies in chairs at these salaries i was in a job that for four years in a row our campus was directed by hr to just cut and paste our evaluations from previous years because good or bad no one was even reading them and getting exceeds expectations on everything over and over again got you probably a lower paycheck the next year in comparison to col changes and this absolutely trickles down to education we cant offer anything more than increasingly worse benefits and a handful of to teachers but we say that you need a masters for a livable wage ml is taking over our school boards and firing minority executive staff across the state so now districts are involved in expensive lawsuits we have kids who depend on us the adults to educate them and give them safe spaces to learn and grow into decent humans but we cant get and retain enough people to keep the classes below kids the turnover rates of sped are insane we dont get any sort of paid leave for pregnancy other than what we can cobble together on our own if we offend jesus we might lose our jobs and we wink while we have to force prayer on muslim kids even though thats totally not what is going on you guys its ok if a white admin demonstrably punishes impoverished black kids with no food on the table at home at much higher rates as a matter of business across the entire state meanwhile our state says theres no money for proper salaries our benefits are falling behind and yet theres mysteriously a budget surplus and they tell us if we dont like it then leave even though we cant replace the people we are smugly telling to f off it is a miserable environment for those of us left trying to keep the lights on at work and at home and also graduate quality students who are going to be ok in the shitstorm of an adulthood we actively feel guilty for leaving them to please understand i dont mean to sound like im ripping your head off but no one seems to realize the trickle down effects of decades upon decades upon decades of what no protections and right to work really means the people who have always had the money and the purse strings dont want you to stop and think and tell you we are the greedy and lazy ones this is how we get a wrestling lady running our national education department unions and right to work states are hell on the people the state is supposed to serve in this country,5,2024,11,21,positive

Labor,1f6coij,labor unions built the middle class and democrats built the unions trumps conservative manifesto project is comprised of hundreds of pages that will rescind civil rights and limit all our government protection and one of the most insidious provisions of this document is to completely eliminate overtime pay for hourly workers overtime is now predicated on a forty hour work week under project that will change to a one hundred sixty hour work month it sounds the same but here is where the villainy creeps in if a worker puts in five extra hours of overtime for three weeks the boss has only to cut his hours in the fourth month to twentyfive hours thus assuring he still works one hundred sixty hours but is not entitled to overtime pay i told you it was insidious the right to overtime pay was won in but that is far from all the improvements unions secured for americans minimum wage was a union achievement as were child labor laws paid vacations sick leave healthcare benefits anti discrimination laws and the right to strike were all won through the support of and encouragement democrat administrations and against the opposition of the gop all this will change under a republican administration a heartless trump administration and once those gains are lost they will never be recovered see this boldface mine workers rights won by unions from the hour workday to overtime pay workers at american companies and institutions of higher learning are making headlines for strikes and unionizing efforts among employees including amazon starbucks rutgers university harpercollins and hollywood writers amid this socalled union boom labor unions are seeing their highest approval ratings since the s with gen z showing up as americas most prounion generation in recent history so its no wonder people are curious about what a union can do for them the overall proportion of unionized workers in the united states remains relatively low with only one in every workers in the country belonging to a union but whether youre a union worker or not you may benefit from policies for which unions have fought long and hard and they continue to fight labor organizing has helped secure everyday benefits that many of us now take for granted and these efforts have shown people what kind of protections they can hope to secure in the workplace lets take a look at examples an eighthour workday twoday weekend and overtime pay most of us probably take the standard fiveday workweek eighthour workday and twoday weekend structure as a given when were asked to work more than this we may even feel like our rights and livelihood are being infringed upon of course many workers take on the extra work anyway the details of this standard schedule are the result of decades of activism first in the federation of organized trades and labor unions passed a resolution that the workday be limited to eight hours as kim kelly has written for teen vogue thanks to robust labor organizing including strikes by the carpenters union and united mine workers of america the fair labor act flsa was finally enacted in among other provisions the flsa established a fiveday workweek thereby creating a twoday weekend in thanks in part to a previously recognized demand from the amalgamated clothing workers of america congress amended the flsa to officially create a hour workweek a minimum wage new zealand was the first country to mandate a minimum wage in the united states didnt follow suit until more than years later women and organizations against child labor had actively campaigned for a minimum wage for those groups since the early s arguing that children were often doing similar work to adults but were paid much lower wages by according to the atlantic states and washington dc passed laws enshrining minimumwage protections specifically for women and children but it wasnt until the late s that this also applied to men and nonunionized workers angered by the unjust wages and layoffs during the great depression unemployed and union workers fought for fairer wages and the flsa was enacted to support fdrs new deal child labor laws recently lawmakers have weakened state child labor laws across the country these regulatory moves are undoing social welfare legislation that has benefited the health and wellbeing of american workers in almost of all american workers were under these children were primarily from lowerincome families and often worked hours or more six days a week in harsh and sometimes hazardous conditions as with the minimum wage federal child labor laws were catalyzed by the great depression though in prior decades there had been an especially strong push by women and labor unions for legislative bodies to pass legislation protecting children the flsa eventually set very specific limits on how many hours children could work outside of school though agricultural work is still done under an entirely different set of rules which has generated controversy paid vacation and holidays in the wake of the great depression unions started to push for paid time off which they negotiated with employers this effort set a standard for twoweeks paid vacation that extended to many nonunion workers as well in the s however as unions lost popularity and influence the european union and other countries started to outpace the united states in requiring paid time off for workers in the center for economic and policy research released a study that found an estimated one in four us workers has no paid time off or paid vacation days whatsoever the united states is alone among the member countries in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd in lacking a national vacation policy or mandated paid holidays join a union though and your chances of getting paid vacation increase profoundly a book from the economic policy institute epi found that after years unionized employees get nearly more vacation weeks than their nonunionized counterparts according to the department of labor these benefits are especially helpful for women particularly women of color those who belong to unions have greater access to paid time off and paid vacation sick leave as with holidays and paid time off union workers are more likely to have sick leave than nonunion workers according to the epi an estimated of union workers have access to paid sick leave while only of nonunion workers enjoy that benefit coming out of the pandemic paid sick leave has become a hot topic of discussion among employees and employers why is paid sick leave so beneficial it reduces the spread of illness with some research estimating that guaranteed paid sick leave would decrease flu rates by at least in addition the reduced stress can help a person get better faster worker health care if youre part of a union you probably enjoy better health care coverage than workers who arent unionized as of twothirds of nonunion workers had health care compared with of union workers according to epi why is this theres a long tradition of unions advocating for health care benefits stretching back to the industrial revolution as unions gained in popularity they made efforts to ensure that their workers would continue to get paid despite sickness or injury although some union leaders initially opposed state health care because they believed it would decrease dependence on unions they later fought for social security in and medicare in and they continue to advocate for better health care for their workers today antidiscrimination protections unions and women workers were at the helm of the equal pay act signed by president john f kennedy in prohibiting sexbased wage discrimination for women doing the same job as men regarding race though unions havent always been on the same page historically some unions sought to exclude certain racial and ethnic groups while others sought to protect them however by the era of the civil rights movement unions started to play a larger role in the fight for racial justice through mobilizing members and political lobbying the civil rights act of and the voting rights act of both codified laws against racial discrimination and were won in part thanks to political lobbying and support by the american federation of labor and congress of industrial organization or aflcio now the largest federation of unions in the united states today labor unions continue to help people fight workplace discrimination right to strike strikes are one of the most visible actions in which unionized workers engage with university employees los angeles teachers hollywood tv writers and more recently taking to the picket lines strikes can help workers win greater protections and benefits higher pay or fairer wages for centuries workers have gone on strike for better working conditions but the actual right to strike is protected thanks to labor unions the national labor relations act of also called the wagner act protects the right to strike and outlines guidelines by which strikes are deemed lawful strikes provide workers with necessary bargaining power to improve working conditions and pay safety regulations or workers comp unions help ensure that members receive workers compensation should they become injured on the job but union insistence on the strict adherence to safety practices has also helped decrease the need for this provision workers compensation is an especially critical issue for union workers some of whom work in highrisk jobs because injuries can result in a long leave and extra expenses workers comp often helps cover medical expenses not just wages unions also help address this issue by offering supplemental benefits such as cash stipends or disability benefits that nonunion workers dont often get some labor unions fought specifically for largescale workers comp that directly related to issues stemming from the hazards of their particular occupation a wellknown example is the black lung benefits act of which was adopted thanks united mine workers a miners union and provides compensation to miners disabled by black lung disease pneumoconiosis protecting public education schooling and education may not be the first things that come to mind when you hear the word union but our public education system and the protections and benefits afforded to teachers owe a lot to unions after the national education associations nea founding in the union took a variety of progressive stances and later focused on a multitude of issues such as raising teacher salaries ending child labor educating emancipated enslaved persons and helping indigenous children subject to forced assimilation as the hechinger report documents the american federation of teachers or aft founded in went on to fight for equal pay for women teachers while the nea fought for the racial integration of schools and to improve education for black students

WorkReform,1g4pah7,i was reading subreddits discussing why it doesnt unionize and people are talking about how they would rather be able to negotiate their own salary increases and hate the idea of lazy workers being protected and one person said if our labor union laws were more like the uks they would be more pro union but just not into american unions to me though its a frustrating point of view because its so short sighted yes maybe you can get a much higher salary but union negotiations are much stronger and are healthier to improve the rights of workers in the industry over time than an individual wed probably have a day work week by now if people didnt only think of themselves but the health of all society for the lazy worker aspect can anyone give insights into that,2,2024,10,17,negative

WorkReform,1fwres2,im totally in favour of workers having more protections and rights and maybe unions are the way to go in a day and age where the average employee isnt represented in government but to be clear strikes will have the most impact when the workers are able to withhold essential services from the public to put pressure on employers from multiple fronts if i went on strike no one would be clamouring for our clients to get access to their sweet sweet market research data and striking coffee shop workers will just drive more people make coffee at home not saying that unions wont help in theory but just want to be clear about the actual potential for strikes in most roles or industries in many places in canada we have government workers not all who make way more than youd expect for the role in part because theyve been able to hold the province or city hostage for it,1,2024,10,5,positive

union,1h4h57i,some unions dont have teeth is what this means but while the structure of is different from another those teeth are the same mouth so to speak my union has teeth because we are super active as members that usually comes down to good organizers and the way the union does or does not forward member engagement opportunities mine is good at all those things and we really make waves it takes lots of people partnering to find issues and solve them but if you dont get paid or get fired in violation of your contract youll see how fast they can protect a worker so depends on what kind of protection you expect also,5,2024,12,1,negative
