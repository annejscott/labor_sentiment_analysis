liberal,1h2wbfg,Why do did so many conservatives vote against their own interests?,"Edit: damn auto correct title. It was supposed to be why did.

This confuses me.

If you want healthier food and companies to no longer poison us, then why would you vote to reduce the FDA? 

Why would you vote to remove those regulations on companies?

If you are against child exploitation and abuse why would you vote to defund the FBI? The only organization that actually fights it?

If you are complaining about our education being ranked so low, then why would you vote to strip it?

If you voted because Harris isn't pro union enough why the fuck would you vote for the people who want to dismantle unions and worker protections?

If you are a farmer and rely on immigrants then why the hell did you vote for them to be deported?

If you want inflation to come down then why  did you vote to increase it with tariffs? Import taxes don't reduce prices, they raise them.

If you are one of those anti woke culture warrior gamer bros who likes anime and complain that video games aren't sexy anymore, wtf did you vote for the people who want to ban porn?

If you want America to lead in science again and beat China , why would you let musk get rid of NASA? ",214,2024-11-29 16:27:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1h2wbfg/why_do_did_so_many_conservatives_vote_against/

liberal,1h257k4,A horrifying reality of Trump's 2nd term. NO ONE is safe from p2025. Am I the only one seeing this?,"Can we start to assume that no one this time in the white house will ever be liable for anything anymore so long as their lips are aligned with Trump's asshole and suck whatever comes out?

No one on his Legion of Doom will ever have consequences for their actions until they devour themselves for power over whatever is left standing when they are done using anyone that goes against them for slave labor.

I've been calling this game MAGAtes and p2025 have laid out for years.. but I need to run it by other liberals that can be objective and tell me I'm not right. I hope I'm not.

If you can follow this logic and have any decent memory of events in the past 3 Republican terms, you might feel like this is an actually real scenario... If I'm way off on something please call me out. I'm not saying this will be exact, but that the end result will be the same regardless of the how's and when's.

We won't have mass deportation like he's saying but there will be laws that ramp up justice arm's power to get rid of and imprison people here slowly over time .. which eventually through p2025 can fall on ANYONE they decide they wish to detain or get rid of.. even US born citizens. They will have the power to decide unilaterally and disregard civil rights and due process.

It will start with the undocumented immigrants they locate.. then find people who are expendable or have criminal records, people with addictions or that have had govt assistance, down to people that just aren't ""American"" enough, dangers or non-patriots.. they will be rounded up to be ""reformed."" They'll use camps for these people and work their way down the list until you have his side, and those suffering doing Chinese/gulag/gestapo-style govt labor to achieve forever power and control over us. You can change the terms and methods but let's assume they can do what they want, because they have everything they need now to do so.

Think it's crazy? Conspiracy? Yeah I get it but sometimes we see things before they happen and never listen to the ones who warned us. But it's all in the 2025 playbook and we've been here before. This time only the people can stop it, but that won't happen when we're scared and shut in our homes asking for help, saying yeah but not MY family right?

All they need to do is what I've been saying for years, declare another seemingly needed, but ultimately bullshit ""war.."" 

I think this time it will be the ""war on immigration"" or something so they can make up emergency war time acts/laws.. just like the war on terror. Which was how we got the patriot act..  remember that? Civil liberties trampled on, privacy violated. We were scared, so they were allowed to quell our fears, but what they were really doing was not targeted at terror and our enemies, but at Americans themselves. 

People are scared again, and just like COVID you get rich by causing a problem and selling the solution. This time I truly feel like they're going to take everything from us.. and what I fear more is that they know we can't sustain our population anymore, and they intend to close ranks, save themselves, and watch the rest of us slowly fade into genocidal memory. 

But I'm crazy of course to say this so fuck me right?",552,2024-11-28 15:40:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1h257k4/a_horrifying_reality_of_trumps_2nd_term_no_one_is/

liberal,1gyvcys,Why do we always have to pretend as though we win every time we start to lose?,"These past few years I can't stand watching liberal and left-wing news or news content creators. By no means have I come anywhere close to giving up or falling for right-wing conspiratorial to outright false talking points, but I can't stand it anymore. I watch MSNBC and the reactions are always the same. Either shock that Trump or his supporters said something, smugness over right wing hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance, or stern scolding to people who aren't watching. And then we act and treat this as a win when Trump supporters don't care. They never will because they already believe that every negative thing about him is fake, if he does do anything he said he wouldn't do it's the right choice or a ploy, and that if what he said doesn't work-out he was misled or sabotage. We act like we haven't been dealing with these people for years. Trump and his supports will never accept a loss even as they are eating the rotten discarded remains.

Even when we do win it's not like they care anyways. I just saw a video about how Trump said the egg prices would go down before he even took office (because of course he is the darn tootenist gosh golly thing to touch the economy since overspeculation, buying on margin, and high variable interest rates) and while I care that eggs are still expensive, I stopped listening to Trumps boasting a long time ago. Trump supporters are still blaming Biden, and they'll continue blame him and other democrats as long as they possibly can. We act like people aren't treating us as villains for cutting out trump supporting family members and friends even though they'll pretend that their crowd has never done that. I can't be brought to care if you cut trump supporters out, by all means it might make your life better, but we act like it's only been a good thing for liberals and democrats. 

I talk to Trump supporters, both in my family and workplace. They haven't ""fallen besides themselves"" since Matt Gaetz withdrew, they see it as either an operation to remove democratic/rhino opposition to Trump's next appointee or as Gaetz willingly and nobly stepping to the side so that the ""Democrat psy-op"" and ""Forged accusations"" won't distract from Trump's next term. We know that handing them the receipts won't convince them because they will have forgotten to read. When they do happen to get a win, we default to talking about our wins that they don't care about, and it just comes across as though we're living in a fantasy land. It's like we're trying to emulate them but somehow missed the point of why they behave like they do.

I'm tired of people acting like it was the rhetoric of the Democrats that caused Trump to win. No, it was the *perceived* rhetoric from morons that caused Trump to win. People keep telling me how Democrats ran on identity politics. NO THEY FUCKING DIDN'T. Trump ran on identity politics and made his moronic constituents believe the Democrats were doing just that.

I'm just... exhausted. I'm tired of fighting the lies. The outright ignorance. The excuses... If any Democrat in office did what Trump did they'd be out of a job. Harris didn't even ask for a recount... which by the way... I think she should've. 

But I suppose Americans want white supremacists and Nazis in control. Because that's what they voted for in this election. Morons in swing states were mad the price of eggs were higher than four years ago so they voted with their wallets instead of their brains. 

Yet somehow... Democrats keep getting blamed for their rhetoric. For acting like they were above everyone else or calling everyone garbage. They never did or said any of that. Trump did though, for sure. 

It's just insane to me the direction this country is heading. And they're doing it because they're mad that inflation is a thing and refuse to understand it's not something the president even controls.

I'm just... exhausted. I'm tired of fighting the lies. The outright ignorance. The excuses... If any Democrat in office did what Trump did they'd be out of a job. Harris didn't even ask for a recount... which by the way... I think she should've. 

But I suppose Americans want white supremacists and Nazis in control. Because that's what they voted for in this election. Morons in swing states were mad the price of eggs were higher than four years ago so they voted with their wallets instead of their brains. 

Yet somehow... Democrats keep getting blamed for their rhetoric. For acting like they were above everyone else or calling everyone garbage. They never did or said any of that. Trump did though, for sure. 

It's just insane to me the direction this country is heading. And they're doing it because they're mad that inflation is a thing and refuse to understand it's not something the president even controls.

Ya know what? Fuck them. I hope they get exactly what they wanted, knowing full well they won't.",793,2024-11-23 22:44:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gyhyok/i_am_beyond_tired_of_the_fucking_double_standards/

liberal,1gxdeh1,United by Conservative hate,"I work blue collar in a deep red state.  So most of the people I deal with on a daily basis are maga.  Lots of people on my facebook are maga.  So this morning I was looking through facebook and there was a post about the 10 Greatest Athletes of all time.  These posts are usually stupid.  How the hell are you going to pick a top 10 out of so many sports.  We can’t even decide on a top 10 in one position of a single sport but we are going to pick one for all sports?  Anyway, the list had people like Pele and Gretzky and Ali and of course LeBron James.  There is no way to unite conservative, white, males, quite like their hatred for LeBron James.  I know men who haven’t watched a game since Jordan was in his prime but every one of them hates LeBron.  “THIS ISN’T ABOUT HIS POLITICS!!!  HE IS OVERRATED AND RUINING THE GAME!”  Yes, it is about politics.  I know because you don’t watch basketball and don’t give a shit about the game but you have very strong feelings about a player that you have never watched play.  It’s like the Kaitlyn Clark/Angel Reese thing.  Want to rile up a white, conservative, woman?  Just tell them you think Reese is a good player.  You don’t even need to mention Clark.  Just complimenting Reese is enough.  My mother has went to hundreds of sporting events to watch her children and grandchildren play various sports.  She couldn’t tell you how the points work in any sport besides maybe Soccer.  She spent 35 years living with a die hard Bears fan and she asked me the other day if I thought the Cubs might make the Super Bowl this year.  But bring up Clark and it’s all “Oh I love her, she plays with class!”  What the fuck does that even mean?  She once told me that Reese only gets the points because she is rebounding her own missed shots.  This woman doesn’t even know what a rebound is.  The whole Bird/Magic thing was a little before my time, was it like this back then?   I say all this because this is why the fight is so hard.  Conservatives are united in their hatred.  United against the libtards and the gay agenda and the war on Christmas and against Wokeness.  Their hatred unites them like nothing units the Left.  On the Left we have different views.  We are united about gun control but we have different views on how to get that done.  We are united on saving the planet from global warming yet we have different views on how to get that done.  Police reform, abortion, public schools, unions, race relations, we are all united in the ideas yet the minutia differs.  Conservative hate though…Trump says hate like this and they hate like this.  Fox News says hate like this and they hate like this.  They are united, and I honestly, have no idea how to fight that.

Police reform, abortion, public schools, unions, race relations, we are all united in the ideas yet the minutia differs.  Conservative hate though…Trump says hate like this and they hate like this.  Fox News says hate like this and they hate like this.  They are united, and I honestly, have no idea how to fight that.

liberal,1gujrx2,AI's Solution to the 2024/2028 Election,"Like most of you, I am just about DONE with MAGA and the GOP and our gullible citizens.  I am at a loss for how to counter their strategy of constant lying, so I went to AI for help.  I think its response has some interesting strategies, so I am copying it here.  Sorry if this breaks some sub rule.

Here's my question: ""So, recently Donald Trump (the Republican Candidate) won the 2024 election over Kamala Harris (the Democratic Candidate).  From what I can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them.  This allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him, while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them.  Use your logical, mathematical mind to determine how Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy.""

The response: 
""Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here’s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do:
1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency

    The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember.
    The Solution:
        Develop 3–5 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., ""Working for Every American"").
        Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes.
        Frame responses to attacks within this narrative. For example, ""That's another distraction; we're focused on [core theme].""

2. Use Selective Fact-Checking Strategically

    The Problem: Countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the ""illusory truth effect,"" where repetition makes lies seem true.
    The Solution:
        Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message.
        Use a ""truth sandwich"" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth.
        Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods.

3. Humanize the Campaign

    The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding.
    The Solution:
        Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly.
        Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles.

4. Leverage Data and Analytics

    The Problem: Lies spread because they are emotionally engaging, often through targeted digital campaigns.
    The Solution:
        Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts.
        Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly.

5. Strengthen Institutional Trust

    The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive.
    The Solution:
        Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness; instead, advocate for transparency and accountability.
        Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages.

6. Call Out the ""Flood of Lies""

    The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out.
    The Solution:
        Introduce the concept of ""lie overload"" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., ""trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies"").
        Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters.

7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism

    The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives.
    The Solution:
        Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented.
        Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation.

8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk

    The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared.
    The Solution:
        Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction.
        For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, ""We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share.""

By sticking to these strategies, a Democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformation-heavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions, rather than just reacting to falsehoods.""",51,2024-11-18 19:06:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gujrx2/ais_solution_to_the_20242028_election/

""Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here’s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do:
1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency

    The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember.
    The Solution:
        Develop 3–5 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., ""Working for Every American"").
        Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes.
        Frame responses to attacks within this narrative. For example, ""That's another distraction; we're focused on [core theme].""

2. Use Selective Fact-Checking Strategically

    The Problem: Countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the ""illusory truth effect,"" where repetition makes lies seem true.
    The Solution:
        Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message.
        Use a ""truth sandwich"" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth.
        Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods.

3. Humanize the Campaign

    The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding.
    The Solution:
        Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly.
        Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles.

4. Leverage Data and Analytics

    The Problem: Lies spread because they are emotionally engaging, often through targeted digital campaigns.
    The Solution:
        Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts.
        Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly.

5. Strengthen Institutional Trust

    The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive.
    The Solution:
        Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness; instead, advocate for transparency and accountability.
        Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages.

6. Call Out the ""Flood of Lies""

    The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out.
    The Solution:
        Introduce the concept of ""lie overload"" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., ""trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies"").
        Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters.

7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism

    The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives.
    The Solution:
        Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented.
        Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation.

8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk

    The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared.
    The Solution:
        Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction.
        For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, ""We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share.""

By sticking to these strategies, a Democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformation-heavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions, rather than just reacting to falsehoods.""",51,2024-11-18 19:06:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gujrx2/ais_solution_to_the_20242028_election/

    The Solution:
        Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message.
        Use a ""truth sandwich"" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth.
        Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods.

3. Humanize the Campaign

    The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding.
    The Solution:
        Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly.
        Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles.

4. Leverage Data and Analytics

    The Problem: Lies spread because they are emotionally engaging, often through targeted digital campaigns.
    The Solution:
        Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts.
        Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly.

5. Strengthen Institutional Trust

    The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive.
    The Solution:
        Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness; instead, advocate for transparency and accountability.
        Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages.

6. Call Out the ""Flood of Lies""

    The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out.
    The Solution:
        Introduce the concept of ""lie overload"" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., ""trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies"").
        Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters.

7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism

    The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives.
    The Solution:
        Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented.
        Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation.

8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk

    The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared.
    The Solution:
        Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction.
        For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, ""We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share.""

By sticking to these strategies, a Democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformation-heavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions, rather than just reacting to falsehoods.""",51,2024-11-18 19:06:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gujrx2/ais_solution_to_the_20242028_election/
liberal,1gujrx2,AI's Solution to the 2024/2028 Election,"Like most of you, I am just about DONE with MAGA and the GOP and our gullible citizens.  I am at a loss for how to counter their strategy of constant lying, so I went to AI for help.  I think its response has some interesting strategies, so I am copying it here.  Sorry if this breaks some sub rule.

Here's my question: ""So, recently Donald Trump (the Republican Candidate) won the 2024 election over Kamala Harris (the Democratic Candidate).  From what I can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them.  This allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him, while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them.  Use your logical, mathematical mind to determine how Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy.""

The response: 
""Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here’s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do:
1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency

    The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember.
    The Solution:
        Develop 3–5 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., ""Working for Every American"").
        Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes.

        Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts.
        Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly.

5. Strengthen Institutional Trust

    The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive.
    The Solution:
        Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness; instead, advocate for transparency and accountability.
        Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages.

6. Call Out the ""Flood of Lies""

    The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out.
    The Solution:
        Introduce the concept of ""lie overload"" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., ""trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies"").
        Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters.

7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism

    The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives.
    The Solution:
        Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented.
        Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation.

8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk

    The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared.
    The Solution:
        Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction.
        For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, ""We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share.""

By sticking to these strategies, a Democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformation-heavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions, rather than just reacting to falsehoods.""",51,2024-11-18 19:06:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gujrx2/ais_solution_to_the_20242028_election/
liberal,1gujrx2,AI's Solution to the 2024/2028 Election,"Like most of you, I am just about DONE with MAGA and the GOP and our gullible citizens.  I am at a loss for how to counter their strategy of constant lying, so I went to AI for help.  I think its response has some interesting strategies, so I am copying it here.  Sorry if this breaks some sub rule.

Here's my question: ""So, recently Donald Trump (the Republican Candidate) won the 2024 election over Kamala Harris (the Democratic Candidate).  From what I can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them.  This allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him, while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them.  Use your logical, mathematical mind to determine how Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy.""

The response: 
""Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here’s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do:
1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency

    The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember.
    The Solution:
        Develop 3–5 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., ""Working for Every American"").
        Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes.
        Frame responses to attacks within this narrative. For example, ""That's another distraction; we're focused on [core theme].""

2. Use Selective Fact-Checking Strategically

    The Problem: Countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the ""illusory truth effect,"" where repetition makes lies seem true.
    The Solution:
        Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message.
        Use a ""truth sandwich"" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth.
        Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods.

3. Humanize the Campaign

    The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding.
    The Solution:
        Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly.
        Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles.

4. Leverage Data and Analytics

7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism

    The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives.
    The Solution:
        Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented.
        Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation.

8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk

    The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared.
    The Solution:
        Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction.
        For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, ""We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share.""

liberal,1gujrx2,AI's Solution to the 2024/2028 Election,"Like most of you, I am just about DONE with MAGA and the GOP and our gullible citizens.  I am at a loss for how to counter their strategy of constant lying, so I went to AI for help.  I think its response has some interesting strategies, so I am copying it here.  Sorry if this breaks some sub rule.

Here's my question: ""So, recently Donald Trump (the Republican Candidate) won the 2024 election over Kamala Harris (the Democratic Candidate).  From what I can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them.  This allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him, while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them.  Use your logical, mathematical mind to determine how Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy.""

The response: 
""Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here’s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do:
1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency

    The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember.
    The Solution:
        Develop 3–5 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., ""Working for Every American"").
        Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes.
        Frame responses to attacks within this narrative. For example, ""That's another distraction; we're focused on [core theme].""

2. Use Selective Fact-Checking Strategically

    The Problem: Countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the ""illusory truth effect,"" where repetition makes lies seem true.
    The Solution:
        Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message.
        Use a ""truth sandwich"" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth.
        Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods.

3. Humanize the Campaign

    The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding.
    The Solution:
        Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly.
        Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles.

4. Leverage Data and Analytics

    The Problem: Lies spread because they are emotionally engaging, often through targeted digital campaigns.
    The Solution:
        Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts.
        Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly.

5. Strengthen Institutional Trust

    The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive.
    The Solution:
        Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness; instead, advocate for transparency and accountability.
        Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages.

6. Call Out the ""Flood of Lies""

    The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out.
    The Solution:
        Introduce the concept of ""lie overload"" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., ""trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies"").
        Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters.

liberal,1gujrx2,AI's Solution to the 2024/2028 Election,"Like most of you, I am just about DONE with MAGA and the GOP and our gullible citizens.  I am at a loss for how to counter their strategy of constant lying, so I went to AI for help.  I think its response has some interesting strategies, so I am copying it here.  Sorry if this breaks some sub rule.

Here's my question: ""So, recently Donald Trump (the Republican Candidate) won the 2024 election over Kamala Harris (the Democratic Candidate).  From what I can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them.  This allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him, while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them.  Use your logical, mathematical mind to determine how Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy.""

The response: 
""Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here’s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do:
1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency

    The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember.
    The Solution:
        Develop 3–5 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., ""Working for Every American"").
        Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes.
        Frame responses to attacks within this narrative. For example, ""That's another distraction; we're focused on [core theme].""

2. Use Selective Fact-Checking Strategically

    The Problem: Countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the ""illusory truth effect,"" where repetition makes lies seem true.
    The Solution:
        Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message.
        Use a ""truth sandwich"" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth.
        Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods.

3. Humanize the Campaign

    The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding.
    The Solution:
        Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly.
        Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles.

4. Leverage Data and Analytics

    The Problem: Lies spread because they are emotionally engaging, often through targeted digital campaigns.
    The Solution:
        Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts.
        Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly.

5. Strengthen Institutional Trust

    The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive.
    The Solution:
        Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness; instead, advocate for transparency and accountability.
        Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages.

6. Call Out the ""Flood of Lies""

    The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out.
    The Solution:
        Introduce the concept of ""lie overload"" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., ""trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies"").
        Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters.

7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism

    The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives.
    The Solution:
        Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented.
        Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation.

8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk

    The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared.
    The Solution:
        Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction.
        For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, ""We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share.""

Here's my question: ""So, recently Donald Trump (the Republican Candidate) won the 2024 election over Kamala Harris (the Democratic Candidate).  From what I can tell he mostly won by spouting an impossible number of lies that were effectively unchallengable because of the sheer number of them.  This allowed his followers to pick and choose which things they wanted to believe about him, while his opponent had to pick a few stances and then either stick with them or be chastised for them.  Use your logical, mathematical mind to determine how Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could successfully counter this strategy.""

The response: 
""Countering a strategy built on an overwhelming volume of misinformation and narrative control requires a structured, multi-layered approach that addresses both the dynamics of truth and human psychology. Here’s a logical breakdown of what Kamala Harris or a future Democratic candidate could do:
1. Prioritize Narrative Simplicity and Consistency

    The Problem: An avalanche of lies is overwhelming because it exploits the cognitive bias of simplicity. Lies that resonate with existing biases are easier for people to remember.
    The Solution:
        Develop 3–5 core themes that resonate emotionally and are easily repeatable (e.g., ""Working for Every American"").
        Use repetition to create cognitive stickiness. Every appearance, speech, and media opportunity should circle back to these core themes.
        Frame responses to attacks within this narrative. For example, ""That's another distraction; we're focused on [core theme].""

2. Use Selective Fact-Checking Strategically

    The Problem: Countering every lie can lead to fatigue or the ""illusory truth effect,"" where repetition makes lies seem true.
    The Solution:
        Choose to debunk high-impact lies that can cause measurable harm or derail the core message.
        Use a ""truth sandwich"" approach: Start with the truth, briefly debunk the lie, and return to the truth.
        Collaborate with trusted media and fact-checking platforms to preemptively debunk repeated falsehoods.

3. Humanize the Campaign

    The Problem: Broadly targeted lies thrive because they lack specific emotional grounding.
    The Solution:
        Focus on individual stories and human connections. Highlight real people and how policies affect them directly.
        Deploy surrogates (trusted community voices, not just politicians) to amplify these stories and refute misinformation within their circles.

4. Leverage Data and Analytics

    The Problem: Lies spread because they are emotionally engaging, often through targeted digital campaigns.
    The Solution:
        Employ micro-targeted ads to reach key demographics with messages tailored to counter misinformation in their specific contexts.
        Monitor misinformation trends using AI and analytics tools to identify and counter viral narratives quickly.

5. Strengthen Institutional Trust

    The Problem: Lies undermine trust in institutions, making it easier for false narratives to thrive.
    The Solution:
        Position the campaign as a force for institutional renewal and reform. Avoid defensiveness; instead, advocate for transparency and accountability.
        Partner with trusted non-political organizations to communicate key messages.

6. Call Out the ""Flood of Lies""

    The Problem: People may not notice the volume and strategy behind misinformation unless it is explicitly pointed out.
    The Solution:
        Introduce the concept of ""lie overload"" into public discourse. Use humor or metaphors (e.g., ""trying to drink truth from a firehose of lies"").
        Highlight patterns of dishonesty rather than individual claims, framing them as disrespectful to voters.

7. Emphasize Unity and Forward-Looking Optimism

    The Problem: Lies can create polarization and fear, which motivates voters to cling to familiar narratives.
    The Solution:
        Offer a vision that is positive, inclusive, and solution-oriented.
        Use optimistic messaging to contrast with the chaos and divisiveness sown by misinformation.

8. Pre-Bunk Before Debunk

    The Problem: Lies often take hold because they meet people unprepared.
    The Solution:
        Anticipate likely misinformation themes and preemptively address them with facts and framing before they gain traction.
        For example, before a false claim about taxes emerges, emphasize, ""We're ensuring tax fairness for working families while billionaires pay their share.""

By sticking to these strategies, a Democratic candidate can navigate the challenges of a misinformation-heavy campaign while maintaining integrity and effectiveness. Ultimately, the goal is to frame the campaign as an advocate for the truth and solutions, rather than just reacting to falsehoods.""",51,2024-11-18 19:06:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gujrx2/ais_solution_to_the_20242028_election/

How would firing black officers make the military stronger?



Isn't that another betrayal of the black maga voters? Many of whom are in the military?


Or the women who joined because their family has a military tradition? My cousin is in the military and she's hard core maga. I'm confused why Republican military women aren't concerned about their jobs.


If the military is struggling with recruitment then why on earth would you ban the people who want to join?",71,2024-11-13 14:36:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gqlg0t/when_they_talk_about_getting_rid_of_the_woke/

liberal,1gpwf4a,Week of rest,"It's been a trying time for liberals in the US these last couple weeks.

I suggest that all liberals just take a week of rest.

Sleep in, read a book, hangout with friends, and generally live life as a human should.

Once the week is done and all Trump, MAGA, corporations, and powers that be will see how helpless the country is without 70 million worker bees running around. And the 70 million worker bees see how strong they are together. This country might actually change for the better.

Workers rights, universal health care, basic human dignity, reproductive rights, LGTBQ rights, climate change and many more would magically be on the table.

If they weren't perhaps another week of rest would be in order.

You might call that a general strike. But I don't think picket lines or protests need to be done.

Take a break from the world that just isn't treating humans as humans and enjoy yourself. Sleep in.",29,2024-11-12 16:44:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gpwf4a/week_of_rest/

You poor things. Ya know, the truth may not be as loud, it may get silenced, or get lost in the sauce, but its always out there. You can only cover your tracks so much before things just start coming up. The rich aren't here to save us. Never have been never will be. A job isn't a job anymore when the boss is your government. One person loses their freedoms the rest follows. History has told us this time and time again. Cutting off trade with tariffs and reinforcing immigration will not help a country that depends on trade for survival, but it will cut us off and distance us from the world more. A liberal media purge which you all assume is fake news, or biased against your beliefs, whatever, means you get one sided, biased, misinformation 24/7. There are no checks and balances on media coverage, meaning we get a constant flood of Trumps message. What he wants us to believe. Hes already done it, who are we even kidding, most of you are so delusional and detatched from reality, this is a waste of time even explaining it, while you think that is the ""right thing for America, make America Great again"" there was never anything wrong with America before Trump. People may have had different views but division and conflict hadn't occurred on this level over American politics GLOBALLY until he was a candidate. People played dirty but they didn't play this dirty. Things that have happened over his candidacy, if you would have asked me a decade ago if anything like what hes done or said sounds like an American President, I would say no. Anyone who is old enough, sane enough, smart enough would agree. Like dude Bush was cooler than this. Republicans were different then, had more integrity. Now, as for him helping the economy, bandaid solutions to gaping wound problems. To fix the economy you have to have people who are clean off drugs, people who are EDUCATED, people who are secure, have homes, access to information and resources, this creates job growth, personal growth, and ensures the happiness and growth of your citizens. Businesses with government regulation, have limits on what they can charge, because businesses unregulated can charge whatever, claim whatever, and get off scot free with minimal consequence. What's that mean? Say you order a defibrillator for emergencies and you have a heart condition and it doesn't work, the company that sold it to you isn't liable for faulty products. Pay up. Does anyone remember company stores? Coal camps? Where businesses owned the town, made the cost of living, made the cost of goods? Miserable. Pay up. Our abundance of year round produce like bananas, pineapples, ect. ect. Tariffs. Trade bans. I know you hate admitting you are wrong, I know it goes against your ""God"" or how you were ""raised"" but take away your religion, take away your political views, you are just hateful, ignorant, narcissistic, detatched, facetious, insecure, delusional, sad and angry little person. Maybe not all of those things, but many combinations of the list, yes. You chose to forsake others for money you won't get to touch, promises that won't be kept, and it will catch up with you. You've chosen ignorance when the Earth is at a pivotal point of deciding to open the mind or stay in the past thinking the past is a path for the future. Thats absolutely insane.

What's that mean? Say you order a defibrillator for emergencies and you have a heart condition and it doesn't work, the company that sold it to you isn't liable for faulty products. Pay up. Does anyone remember company stores? Coal camps? Where businesses owned the town, made the cost of living, made the cost of goods? Miserable. Pay up. Our abundance of year round produce like bananas, pineapples, ect. ect. Tariffs. Trade bans. I know you hate admitting you are wrong, I know it goes against your ""God"" or how you were ""raised"" but take away your religion, take away your political views, you are just hateful, ignorant, narcissistic, detatched, facetious, insecure, delusional, sad and angry little person. Maybe not all of those things, but many combinations of the list, yes. You chose to forsake others for money you won't get to touch, promises that won't be kept, and it will catch up with you. You've chosen ignorance when the Earth is at a pivotal point of deciding to open the mind or stay in the past thinking the past is a path for the future. Thats absolutely insane. And this is just for you Reddit Conservative Republican Christians who keep coming over here with your stupid show your small dick mentality.

He flooded the media both Conservative and Liberal for 12 years I call fraud on account of Stockholm Syndrome and misinformation based fraud combined with the effects of repetition frequency on the illusory truth effect.

You think you are big tough strong masculine bullies, but you are literally simping over an old man. You couldn't ride a dick any harder if you tried. Secondly a majority vote doesn't mean someone is more right than the other, all it means is you idiots are louder, and reproduce more. I hope you comment on my post, because I love your hatred, I'm going to bathe myself in it, and not even give you the satisfaction of responding to it, because I am already the bigger person by deciding not to, not that I would waste my breath or brain cells going in circles with you morons playing the ""I know you are but what am I?"" thing you filthy commies have been doing justifying your hatred by misdirecting to economics, and yes, hes taking advantage of all you poor, uneducated, prejudiced, misinformed, lazy, entitled, desperate, ""alphas"". You poor things. Ya know, the truth may not be as loud, it may get silenced, or get lost in the sauce, but its always out there. You can only cover your tracks so much before things just start coming up. The rich aren't here to save us. Never have been never will be. A job isn't a job anymore when the boss is your government. One person loses their freedoms the rest follows. History has told us this time and time again. Cutting off trade with tariffs and reinforcing immigration will not help a country that depends on trade for survival, but it will cut us off and distance us from the world more. A liberal media purge which you all assume is fake news, or biased against your beliefs, whatever, means you get one sided, biased, misinformation 24/7. There are no checks and balances on media coverage, meaning we get a constant flood of Trumps message. What he wants us to believe. Hes already done it, who are we even kidding, most of you are so delusional and detatched from reality, this is a waste of time even explaining it, while you think that is the ""right thing for America, make America Great again"" there was never anything wrong with America before Trump. People may have had different views but division and conflict hadn't occurred on this level over American politics GLOBALLY until he was a candidate. People played dirty but they didn't play this dirty. Things that have happened over his candidacy, if you would have asked me a decade ago if anything like what hes done or said sounds like an American President, I would say no. Anyone who is old enough, sane enough, smart enough would agree. Like dude Bush was cooler than this. Republicans were different then, had more integrity. Now, as for him helping the economy, bandaid solutions to gaping wound problems. To fix the economy you have to have people who are clean off drugs, people who are EDUCATED, people who are secure, have homes, access to information and resources, this creates job growth, personal growth, and ensures the happiness and growth of your citizens. Businesses with government regulation, have limits on what they can charge, because businesses unregulated can charge whatever, claim whatever, and get off scot free with minimal consequence. What's that mean? Say you order a defibrillator for emergencies and you have a heart condition and it doesn't work, the company that sold it to you isn't liable for faulty products. Pay up. Does anyone remember company stores? Coal camps? Where businesses owned the town, made the cost of living, made the cost of goods? Miserable. Pay up. Our abundance of year round produce like bananas, pineapples, ect. ect. Tariffs. Trade bans. I know you hate admitting you are wrong, I know it goes against your ""God"" or how you were ""raised"" but take away your religion, take away your political views, you are just hateful, ignorant, narcissistic, detatched, facetious, insecure, delusional, sad and angry little person. Maybe not all of those things, but many combinations of the list, yes. You chose to forsake others for money you won't get to touch, promises that won't be kept, and it will catch up with you. You've chosen ignorance when the Earth is at a pivotal point of deciding to open the mind or stay in the past thinking the past is a path for the future. Thats absolutely insane. And this is just for you Reddit Conservative Republican Christians who keep coming over here with your stupid show your small dick mentality. Now as for the rest of your votes that win you the election? Fake fascist commie Fox news. Voter fraud. We demand a recount. We won the election before it happened. Russia interfered in the election. He cheated. Hes senile. Hes a risk to national security. Tired Trump. He flooded the media both Conservative and Liberal for 12 years I call fraud on account of Stockholm Syndrome and misinformation based fraud combined with the effects of repetition frequency on the illusory truth effect. Hes already held you captive for 12 years. People just want you poor saps to wake up before you drink the freaking Kool-aid because they care about you. They fact check you because they care about you. They don't want you WOKE they just want you to OPEN YOUR FUCKING EYES. *mic drop* And don't expect a reply.",133,2024-11-11 02:48:50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1gon2jn/glad_to_see_we_have_visitors/

liberal,1g5xs4e,Conservative coworker is amped after Harris' interview,"First, anytime there is something significant that happens with this whole race; the debate, an interview, etc. she doesn't speak to me at all. It will take her until next week before she even acknowledges my presence. (She's older. Gotta be mid/late 50s.)

I actually forgot the interview was on yesterday. Things were just so busy for me between work and my kids, I just didn't keep up with much of anything. I read some of the articles today about how it went.

My coworker has done nothing but go from conservative buddy to conservative buddy and just rage about what was said. Everything Harris does and says is wrong. Why watch at all?! It's self-flagellation at this point. Someone finally asked her where she gets her information from. ""I mean, I keep news on my phone all day long, I just listen to it on my headphones."" Fox News. All day long. My alcoholic grandfather put himself in the grave doing the exact same thing.

In the last half hour or so, it's turned into ""both sides are going crazy."" Yea...both sides. Just listening to music and swaying.

It's just completely bananas to me. Entertaining overall. I can't help but be tickled by how manic they become.",437,2024-10-17 14:28:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1g5xs4e/conservative_coworker_is_amped_after_harris/

liberal,1ft93m4,I voted today; Very odd interaction as I left.,"First, I got my vote in today. Excited and relieved to have it done.

On to the drama. I was in the registrar's office for maybe a total of 4 minutes. It was really fast. As I'm putting my ballot into the machine, a guy walks through the door behind me.

liberal,1flfz7z,"Democrats emphasize policy and ideals vs results / impact too much. Democrats are also unwilling to highlight ""geographic wins"". ","I will preface this by saying that I realize that this is probably an unpopular opinion. I am also just explaining my experience. I'm a liberal Democrat living in a swing state in the Great Lakes region. My friends, family, and co-workers have a wide range of political beliefs and have various backgrounds. One interesting thing that I've noticed is that a lot of liberal Democrats have what I feel like is a warped view of what attracts people to Trump and the Republican party now a days. I'll admit that I had these same beliefs for a long time, but in talking to especially more a-political / moderate independents, it just doesn't seem to be holding up.

Online it seems like a lot of liberal Democrats think that it's just obvious that Democrats are the better choice economically for people who are not in the top 10% income wise. And pretty much better on every other quality of life issue. And therefore assume that any white a-political / independent / really anyone attracted to Trump and Republicans must be attracted to Trump due to his social policies and rhetoric on things like immigration, race, LGBTQ, etc.

This leads to the whole geographic thing. I can't tell you how many times I've heard something like ""Kamala Harris is a Californian liberal. Liberals took states like California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania (I just saw a comment about liberals destroying Connecticut), etc., and have ruined them. ""Red states"" like Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Kansas, Tennessee, etc., are all doing so much better and they are doing better because of the people, policies, and politics. Democrats in turn tend to just try to either claim these red states as being more blue (or highlight blue cities in them) or say that the ""failing"" states are actually more conservative than people think. Or they might trot out a list of data showing ""blue"" states doing objectively better than ""red"" states. But Republicans are quick to say that basically all Red states that have negative data have negative data because of the Federal government and the civil war. At least where I live there is a pretty common belief (that trends across political beliefs) that the ""liberal"" states I mentioned are way worse than the ""red"" states I mentioned and that this due to the people, politics, and policies of those places (and that naturally/historically those liberal places should be much better and the red places much worse). Also that while Republicans may control ""liberal"" states mentioned (and Democrats ""red"" states I mentioned), this doesn't overcome the idea that the ""liberal"" states are liberal (and their destruction rests at the hands of the Democrats) and the ""red"" states are conservative (and their success rests at the hands of Republicans). 

 I have come across numerous people who say they dislike Trump and a lot of the Republican's messaging but that Republicans just govern better. I get that different personalities are attracted to different parties. And that it's more natural for Republicans to demonize entire states and cities than it is for Democrats.

I just wish that Democrats would start focusing how how Republicans have ruined the quality of life for average Americans in places that are both actually controlled by Republican politicians AND are considered ""red"" for the average American.

liberal,1flfz7z,"Democrats emphasize policy and ideals vs results / impact too much. Democrats are also unwilling to highlight ""geographic wins"". ","I will preface this by saying that I realize that this is probably an unpopular opinion. I am also just explaining my experience. I'm a liberal Democrat living in a swing state in the Great Lakes region. My friends, family, and co-workers have a wide range of political beliefs and have various backgrounds. One interesting thing that I've noticed is that a lot of liberal Democrats have what I feel like is a warped view of what attracts people to Trump and the Republican party now a days. I'll admit that I had these same beliefs for a long time, but in talking to especially more a-political / moderate independents, it just doesn't seem to be holding up.

Online it seems like a lot of liberal Democrats think that it's just obvious that Democrats are the better choice economically for people who are not in the top 10% income wise. And pretty much better on every other quality of life issue. And therefore assume that any white a-political / independent / really anyone attracted to Trump and Republicans must be attracted to Trump due to his social policies and rhetoric on things like immigration, race, LGBTQ, etc.

I think this is a huge disconnect between what Democrats think attract swing voters to Trump and what actually does. Pretty much all of the radio, tv, and print commercials I'm hearing / reading for Trump focus on the economy. 

Another big thing is this idea that Democrats ruin the quality of life in a place. There seems to be a disconnect where Republicans talk about impact (often in an anecdotal way) / perceived quality of life and Democrats talk about policies / ideals and sometimes data (that is often disconnected from anecdotal impact). This leads to the whole geographic thing. I can't tell you how many times I've heard something like ""Kamala Harris is a Californian liberal. Liberals took states like California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania (I just saw a comment about liberals destroying Connecticut), etc., and have ruined them. ""Red states"" like Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Kansas, Tennessee, etc., are all doing so much better and they are doing better because of the people, policies, and politics. Democrats in turn tend to just try to either claim these red states as being more blue (or highlight blue cities in them) or say that the ""failing"" states are actually more conservative than people think. Or they might trot out a list of data showing ""blue"" states doing objectively better than ""red"" states. But Republicans are quick to say that basically all Red states that have negative data have negative data because of the Federal government and the civil war. At least where I live there is a pretty common belief (that trends across political beliefs) that the ""liberal"" states I mentioned are way worse than the ""red"" states I mentioned and that this due to the people, politics, and policies of those places (and that naturally/historically those liberal places should be much better and the red places much worse). Also that while Republicans may control ""liberal"" states mentioned (and Democrats ""red"" states I mentioned), this doesn't overcome the idea that the ""liberal"" states are liberal (and their destruction rests at the hands of the Democrats) and the ""red"" states are conservative (and their success rests at the hands of Republicans). 

 I have come across numerous people who say they dislike Trump and a lot of the Republican's messaging but that Republicans just govern better. I get that different personalities are attracted to different parties. And that it's more natural for Republicans to demonize entire states and cities than it is for Democrats. I also get that again probably due to the types of people the Democratic party attracts, Democrats tend to focus on data and policies /ideology. I just wish that Democrats would start focusing how how Republicans have ruined the quality of life for average Americans in places that are both actually controlled by Republican politicians AND are considered ""red"" for the average American.

At least where I live there is a pretty common belief (that trends across political beliefs) that the ""liberal"" states I mentioned are way worse than the ""red"" states I mentioned and that this due to the people, politics, and policies of those places (and that naturally/historically those liberal places should be much better and the red places much worse).

liberal,1flfz7z,"Democrats emphasize policy and ideals vs results / impact too much. Democrats are also unwilling to highlight ""geographic wins"". ","I will preface this by saying that I realize that this is probably an unpopular opinion. I am also just explaining my experience. I'm a liberal Democrat living in a swing state in the Great Lakes region. My friends, family, and co-workers have a wide range of political beliefs and have various backgrounds. One interesting thing that I've noticed is that a lot of liberal Democrats have what I feel like is a warped view of what attracts people to Trump and the Republican party now a days. I'll admit that I had these same beliefs for a long time, but in talking to especially more a-political / moderate independents, it just doesn't seem to be holding up.

Online it seems like a lot of liberal Democrats think that it's just obvious that Democrats are the better choice economically for people who are not in the top 10% income wise. And pretty much better on every other quality of life issue. And therefore assume that any white a-political / independent / really anyone attracted to Trump and Republicans must be attracted to Trump due to his social policies and rhetoric on things like immigration, race, LGBTQ, etc.

I think this is a huge disconnect between what Democrats think attract swing voters to Trump and what actually does. Pretty much all of the radio, tv, and print commercials I'm hearing / reading for Trump focus on the economy. 

Another big thing is this idea that Democrats ruin the quality of life in a place. There seems to be a disconnect where Republicans talk about impact (often in an anecdotal way) / perceived quality of life and Democrats talk about policies / ideals and sometimes data (that is often disconnected from anecdotal impact). This leads to the whole geographic thing. I can't tell you how many times I've heard something like ""Kamala Harris is a Californian liberal. Liberals took states like California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania (I just saw a comment about liberals destroying Connecticut), etc., and have ruined them. ""Red states"" like Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Kansas, Tennessee, etc., are all doing so much better and they are doing better because of the people, policies, and politics. Democrats in turn tend to just try to either claim these red states as being more blue (or highlight blue cities in them) or say that the ""failing"" states are actually more conservative than people think. Or they might trot out a list of data showing ""blue"" states doing objectively better than ""red"" states. But Republicans are quick to say that basically all Red states that have negative data have negative data because of the Federal government and the civil war. At least where I live there is a pretty common belief (that trends across political beliefs) that the ""liberal"" states I mentioned are way worse than the ""red"" states I mentioned and that this due to the people, politics, and policies of those places (and that naturally/historically those liberal places should be much better and the red places much worse). Also that while Republicans may control ""liberal"" states mentioned (and Democrats ""red"" states I mentioned), this doesn't overcome the idea that the ""liberal"" states are liberal (and their destruction rests at the hands of the Democrats) and the ""red"" states are conservative (and their success rests at the hands of Republicans). 

 I have come across numerous people who say they dislike Trump and a lot of the Republican's messaging but that Republicans just govern better. I get that different personalities are attracted to different parties. And that it's more natural for Republicans to demonize entire states and cities than it is for Democrats. I also get that again probably due to the types of people the Democratic party attracts, Democrats tend to focus on data and policies /ideology. I just wish that Democrats would start focusing how how Republicans have ruined the quality of life for average Americans in places that are both actually controlled by Republican politicians AND are considered ""red"" for the average American.

Another big thing is this idea that Democrats ruin the quality of life in a place. There seems to be a disconnect where Republicans talk about impact (often in an anecdotal way) / perceived quality of life and Democrats talk about policies / ideals and sometimes data (that is often disconnected from anecdotal impact). This leads to the whole geographic thing. I can't tell you how many times I've heard something like ""Kamala Harris is a Californian liberal. Liberals took states like California, New York, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania (I just saw a comment about liberals destroying Connecticut), etc., and have ruined them. ""Red states"" like Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Kansas, Tennessee, etc., are all doing so much better and they are doing better because of the people, policies, and politics. Democrats in turn tend to just try to either claim these red states as being more blue (or highlight blue cities in them) or say that the ""failing"" states are actually more conservative than people think. Or they might trot out a list of data showing ""blue"" states doing objectively better than ""red"" states. But Republicans are quick to say that basically all Red states that have negative data have negative data because of the Federal government and the civil war. At least where I live there is a pretty common belief (that trends across political beliefs) that the ""liberal"" states I mentioned are way worse than the ""red"" states I mentioned and that this due to the people, politics, and policies of those places (and that naturally/historically those liberal places should be much better and the red places much worse). Also that while Republicans may control ""liberal"" states mentioned (and Democrats ""red"" states I mentioned), this doesn't overcome the idea that the ""liberal"" states are liberal (and their destruction rests at the hands of the Democrats) and the ""red"" states are conservative (and their success rests at the hands of Republicans). 

 I have come across numerous people who say they dislike Trump and a lot of the Republican's messaging but that Republicans just govern better. I get that different personalities are attracted to different parties. And that it's more natural for Republicans to demonize entire states and cities than it is for Democrats. I also get that again probably due to the types of people the Democratic party attracts, Democrats tend to focus on data and policies /ideology. I just wish that Democrats would start focusing how how Republicans have ruined the quality of life for average Americans in places that are both actually controlled by Republican politicians AND are considered ""red"" for the average American. Because Republicans are sure doing that in reverse and it's resonating a lot with swing voters.

liberal,1eikytq,What kind of prosecutor was Kamala Harris? Setting the facts straight,"I've seen in a lot of comments, and heard from some friends in real life as well, opinions that are very negative about Kamala's experience as a district attorney and then attorney general. Basically anyone claiming ""Kamala was a cop"".

Looking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair. I doubt there's a prosecutor in the country who I agree with as a liberal on every decision. But despite this, prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system. And it is really simply incorrect to claim that Kamala was just ""a cop"", or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record.

  
1. Harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution. While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced/). Only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure, most probably for extenuated issues.

liberal,1eikytq,What kind of prosecutor was Kamala Harris? Setting the facts straight,"I've seen in a lot of comments, and heard from some friends in real life as well, opinions that are very negative about Kamala's experience as a district attorney and then attorney general. Basically anyone claiming ""Kamala was a cop"".

Looking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair. I doubt there's a prosecutor in the country who I agree with as a liberal on every decision. But despite this, prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system. And it is really simply incorrect to claim that Kamala was just ""a cop"", or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record.

  
1. Harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution. While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced/).

While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced/). Only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure, most probably for extenuated issues. 

Of course, since then the Biden-Harris administration [reclassified marijuana](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248205659/marijuana-reclassify-biden-less-restrictions) and she's the first mainstream [presidential candidate to be pro-legalization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2024/07/22/where-does-kamala-harris-stand-on-marijuana/).

2. One of Harris' biggest initatives as DA was ""Back on Track"", which provided housing, job training, and substance abuse treatment for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession. [The program was really successful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/), greatly reducing the rate of re-offenses, and [saved tax payers money](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/BackonTrackFS.pdf).

3. She's always been consistently against the [death penalty](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/466546-harris-campaign-releases-ad-on-opposition-to-death-penalty/). As [written in 2004](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/New-D-A-promises-to-be-smart-on-crime-Harris-2831205.php) when she was elected to SF DA: ""Harris has pledged to continue Hallinan's practice of supporting patients receiving medical marijuana, refusing to seek the death penalty and prosecuting three-strike offenders only for serious or violent felonies."" 

""It takes much more than building prisons and locking away prisoners to keep our city safe,"" Harris said.

4. As AG, she created a [new division and initiative](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism) to help first time offenders reintegrate in society and avoid repeat crimes. She also [refused to enforce Prop 8](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/harris-vows-to-abandon-prop-8/1860319/), the ban on gay marriage on California eventually declared unconstitutional.

This judgment sends a clear message: there is a cost to this kind of predatory conduct,” said Attorney General Harris. “My office will continue to do everything in our power to help these vulnerable students obtain all available relief, as they work to achieve their academic and professional goals.”

Looking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair.

Looking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair. I doubt there's a prosecutor in the country who I agree with as a liberal on every decision. But despite this, prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system. And it is really simply incorrect to claim that Kamala was just ""a cop"", or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record.

  
1. Harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution. While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced/). Only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure, most probably for extenuated issues. 

Of course, since then the Biden-Harris administration [reclassified marijuana](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248205659/marijuana-reclassify-biden-less-restrictions) and she's the first mainstream [presidential candidate to be pro-legalization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2024/07/22/where-does-kamala-harris-stand-on-marijuana/).

2. One of Harris' biggest initatives as DA was ""Back on Track"", which provided housing, job training, and substance abuse treatment for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession. [The program was really successful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/), greatly reducing the rate of re-offenses, and [saved tax payers money](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/BackonTrackFS.pdf). In the end, it was so successful that other cities around the country like [Baltimore](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2015/05/14/mosby-new-program-gives-nonviolent-offenders-a-second-chance/) and Philly copied it as well.

3. She's always been consistently against the [death penalty](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/466546-harris-campaign-releases-ad-on-opposition-to-death-penalty/). As [written in 2004](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/New-D-A-promises-to-be-smart-on-crime-Harris-2831205.php) when she was elected to SF DA: ""Harris has pledged to continue Hallinan's practice of supporting patients receiving medical marijuana, refusing to seek the death penalty and prosecuting three-strike offenders only for serious or violent felonies."" 

""It takes much more than building prisons and locking away prisoners to keep our city safe,"" Harris said.

4. As AG, she created a [new division and initiative](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism) to help first time offenders reintegrate in society and avoid repeat crimes. She also [refused to enforce Prop 8](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/harris-vows-to-abandon-prop-8/1860319/), the ban on gay marriage on California eventually declared unconstitutional.

**Now, who did Harris really prosecute hard? Large corporations, polluters, and banks.**

5. She [fought for big banks to pay $20 billlion to California home owners during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and won](https://fortune.com/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-jamie-dimon-settlement-california-homeowners-big-banks-financial-crisis/).

6. She also won a $1.1 billion settlement [from a predatory for-profit school](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-obtains-11-billion-judgment-against-predatory): “For years, Corinthian profited off the backs of poor people – now they have to pay. This judgment sends a clear message: there is a cost to this kind of predatory conduct,” said Attorney General Harris. “My office will continue to do everything in our power to help these vulnerable students obtain all available relief, as they work to achieve their academic and professional goals.”

6. She pushed for the [passage of the Homeowner's Bill of Rights in California](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/calif-attorney-general-kamala-harris-fights-for-struggling-homeowners/), and won [hundreds of millions](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-suntrust-mortgage-settlement-20140618-story.html) back for homeowners from banks for multiple abuses.

7. She recovered [hundreds of millions](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-to-receive-hundreds-of-millions-in-bank-of-america-settlement-mortgage-kamala-harris-department-of-justice/) for state pensions from Bank of America who mismanaged their investments in 2009. 

8. She won $[241 million from ](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-may-20-la-fi-quest-settlement-20110520-story.html)a company overcharging Medi-Cal, and [$323 million from another](https://legalnewsline.com/stories/510527871-harris-323m-scan-settlement-record-recovery-for-calif-program). 

9. She held [shipping companies behind an oil spill](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/44-million-settles-Cosco-Busan-oil-spill-in-bay-2308869.php) responsible for $44 million for environmental clean-up, [fined a company behind a pipeline](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-barbara-county-oil-spill-20160517-snap-story.html) spill in Santa Barbara, and [fined BP and Arco $14 million for unsafe oil storage](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/BP-Arco-to-pay-14-million-in-suit-over-gas-10621426.php) practices.

liberal,1eikytq,What kind of prosecutor was Kamala Harris? Setting the facts straight,"I've seen in a lot of comments, and heard from some friends in real life as well, opinions that are very negative about Kamala's experience as a district attorney and then attorney general. Basically anyone claiming ""Kamala was a cop"".

Looking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair. I doubt there's a prosecutor in the country who I agree with as a liberal on every decision. But despite this, prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system. And it is really simply incorrect to claim that Kamala was just ""a cop"", or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record.

  
1. Harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution. While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced/). Only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure, most probably for extenuated issues. 

Of course, since then the Biden-Harris administration [reclassified marijuana](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248205659/marijuana-reclassify-biden-less-restrictions) and she's the first mainstream [presidential candidate to be pro-legalization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2024/07/22/where-does-kamala-harris-stand-on-marijuana/).

2. One of Harris' biggest initatives as DA was ""Back on Track"", which provided housing, job training, and substance abuse treatment for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession. [The program was really successful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/), greatly reducing the rate of re-offenses, and [saved tax payers money](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/BackonTrackFS.pdf). In the end, it was so successful that other cities around the country like [Baltimore](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2015/05/14/mosby-new-program-gives-nonviolent-offenders-a-second-chance/) and Philly copied it as well.

3. She's always been consistently against the [death penalty](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/466546-harris-campaign-releases-ad-on-opposition-to-death-penalty/). As [written in 2004](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/New-D-A-promises-to-be-smart-on-crime-Harris-2831205.php) when she was elected to SF DA: ""Harris has pledged to continue Hallinan's practice of supporting patients receiving medical marijuana, refusing to seek the death penalty and prosecuting three-strike offenders only for serious or violent felonies."" 

""It takes much more than building prisons and locking away prisoners to keep our city safe,"" Harris said.

4. As AG, she created a [new division and initiative](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism) to help first time offenders reintegrate in society and avoid repeat crimes. She also [refused to enforce Prop 8](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/harris-vows-to-abandon-prop-8/1860319/), the ban on gay marriage on California eventually declared unconstitutional.

**Now, who did Harris really prosecute hard? Large corporations, polluters, and banks.**

5. She [fought for big banks to pay $20 billlion to California home owners during the 2008-2009 financial crisis, and won](https://fortune.com/2024/07/22/kamala-harris-jamie-dimon-settlement-california-homeowners-big-banks-financial-crisis/).

6. She also won a $1.1 billion settlement [from a predatory for-profit school](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-obtains-11-billion-judgment-against-predatory): “For years, Corinthian profited off the backs of poor people – now they have to pay. This judgment sends a clear message: there is a cost to this kind of predatory conduct,” said Attorney General Harris. “My office will continue to do everything in our power to help these vulnerable students obtain all available relief, as they work to achieve their academic and professional goals.”

6. She pushed for the [passage of the Homeowner's Bill of Rights in California](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/calif-attorney-general-kamala-harris-fights-for-struggling-homeowners/), and won [hundreds of millions](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-suntrust-mortgage-settlement-20140618-story.html) back for homeowners from banks for multiple abuses.

7. She recovered [hundreds of millions](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/california-to-receive-hundreds-of-millions-in-bank-of-america-settlement-mortgage-kamala-harris-department-of-justice/) for state pensions from Bank of America who mismanaged their investments in 2009. 

8. She won $[241 million from ](https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2011-may-20-la-fi-quest-settlement-20110520-story.html)a company overcharging Medi-Cal, and [$323 million from another](https://legalnewsline.com/stories/510527871-harris-323m-scan-settlement-record-recovery-for-calif-program). 

9. She held [shipping companies behind an oil spill](https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/44-million-settles-Cosco-Busan-oil-spill-in-bay-2308869.php) responsible for $44 million for environmental clean-up, [fined a company behind a pipeline](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-santa-barbara-county-oil-spill-20160517-snap-story.html) spill in Santa Barbara, and [fined BP and Arco $14 million for unsafe oil storage](https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/BP-Arco-to-pay-14-million-in-suit-over-gas-10621426.php) practices.

liberal,1eikytq,What kind of prosecutor was Kamala Harris? Setting the facts straight,"I've seen in a lot of comments, and heard from some friends in real life as well, opinions that are very negative about Kamala's experience as a district attorney and then attorney general. Basically anyone claiming ""Kamala was a cop"".

Looking into this, I did a lot of research and wanted to share just some of the things I found. First, I think it's important to acknowledge that being a prosecutor is a tough job, one that deals with tough moral situations, especially as part of a social justice system that is often biased and unfair. I doubt there's a prosecutor in the country who I agree with as a liberal on every decision. But despite this, prosecutors obviously serve a crucially important role in any legal system. And it is really simply incorrect to claim that Kamala was just ""a cop"", or inherently or entirely illiberal in her legal record.

  
1. Harris had a liberal record for the time on marijuana prosecution. While DA of San Francisco, her office's policy [was to not seek jail time for mere possession](https://www.marijuanamoment.net/trump-claims-harris-jailed-thousands-and-thousands-of-black-people-over-marijuana-but-her-actual-record-as-a-prosecutor-is-more-nuanced/). Only a handful of people were jailed for possession under her tenure, most probably for extenuated issues. 

Of course, since then the Biden-Harris administration [reclassified marijuana](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/30/1248205659/marijuana-reclassify-biden-less-restrictions) and she's the first mainstream [presidential candidate to be pro-legalization](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dariosabaghi/2024/07/22/where-does-kamala-harris-stand-on-marijuana/).

2. One of Harris' biggest initatives as DA was ""Back on Track"", which provided housing, job training, and substance abuse treatment for nonviolent offenders charged with drug possession. [The program was really successful](https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2020/08/10/kamala-harris-progressive-pioneer-san-francisco-da-column/3334668001/), greatly reducing the rate of re-offenses, and [saved tax payers money](https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/Publications/BackonTrackFS.pdf). In the end, it was so successful that other cities around the country like [Baltimore](https://www.baltimoresun.com/2015/05/14/mosby-new-program-gives-nonviolent-offenders-a-second-chance/) and Philly copied it as well.

3. She's always been consistently against the [death penalty](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/466546-harris-campaign-releases-ad-on-opposition-to-death-penalty/). As [written in 2004](https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/New-D-A-promises-to-be-smart-on-crime-Harris-2831205.php) when she was elected to SF DA: ""Harris has pledged to continue Hallinan's practice of supporting patients receiving medical marijuana, refusing to seek the death penalty and prosecuting three-strike offenders only for serious or violent felonies."" 

""It takes much more than building prisons and locking away prisoners to keep our city safe,"" Harris said.

4. As AG, she created a [new division and initiative](https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-kamala-d-harris-launches-initiative-reduce-recidivism) to help first time offenders reintegrate in society and avoid repeat crimes. She also [refused to enforce Prop 8](https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/harris-vows-to-abandon-prop-8/1860319/), the ban on gay marriage on California eventually declared unconstitutional.

This judgment sends a clear message: there is a cost to this kind of predatory conduct,” said Attorney General Harris. “My office will continue to do everything in our power to help these vulnerable students obtain all available relief, as they work to achieve their academic and professional goals.”

liberal,1eglpmj,Harris VP Shortlist-Pros and Cons,"Sorry, not sure if this is against the rules of the Subreddit (really sorry if it is), but I thought it would be fun to make a pros and cons list for each of the three candidates who appear to be in the VP shortlist: Andy Beshear, Pete Buttigieg, Mark Kelly, Josh Shapiro and Tim Walz.

 I'm not going to give my own opinion, and this list is not necessarily representative about my own opinion. 

Likewise, if I list a position a candidate has taken as a con, that is not a criticism of that position, just a reflection over how I believe it could play in November.


Andy Beshear

Pros:
-Young
-Proven track record of winning in a red state, on issues important to the Democratic base such as abortion and protecting trans youth
-Seen as highly competent, dealt natural disasters/emergencies well
-Can attack Vance
-Appeals to blue-collar voters
-Strong with labor unions but not seen as too progressive to turn off swing voters
-Record of bipartisanship
-Very popular in Kentucky
-Connects well with voters
-Is a governor, could bring a different type of experience to the ticket

Cons:
-Republicans will bash him as having been born with a ""silver spoon"" in his mouth, could open ticket to ""Democratic elite"" attacks
-Kentucky isn't in play
-Concerns among some groups over record on abortion


Pete Buttigieg

Pros:
-Young
-Talented attack dog
-Strong communicator
-Could have good chemistry with Harris-their husbands are friends.
-Strong fundraiser
-Would invigorate the base
-From Midwest, his husband is from Michigan
-Inspiring story
-Connects well with voters
-Served in Afghanistan
-Helped implement much of the Build Back Better Plan

Cons:
-Will be criticised over response to East Palestine train derailment
-Could turn off swing voters
-Served with Harris in Biden administration, an administration that is, unfortunately (and I would argue unjustly) unpopular
-Will be blamed for air travel delays.
-Has not served in statewide or federal elected office



Mark Kelly

Pros:
-From a swing state
-Proven track record of winning in a swing state (including in a year where the environment was hostile to Democrats)
-Inspiring personal story
-Was an astronaut/Navy Captain
-Blunts attacks on Harris over immigration
-Gun control advocacy could invigorate the base
-Is seen as knowledgeable and is well-regarded by colleagues
-Considered a pragmatist, won't turn off centrists
-Attuned to local issues in Arizona, such as water conservation 

Cons: 
-Not from the Midwest
-Arizona borders California, so he doesn't really add much geographic diversity to the ticket
-Didn't cosponsor PRO Act-could hurt campaign's standing with unions and progressives
-Concerns about his strength as a speaker and ability to connect with voters
-Democrats could struggle to hold his Senate seat in a special election


Josh Shapiro

Pros:
-From Pennsylvania, the biggest swing state
-Has a track record of running ahead of other Democratic candidates in Pennsylvania
-Investigated child sexual abuse within the Catholic Church
-Is seen as a competent governor 
-Received praise from across the political spectrum for his response to the Interstate 95 Collapse
-As a governor, could bring a different type of experience to the ticket
-Is a brilliant speaker
-Strong fundraiser

Cons:
-Support for school-choice could hurt campaign with unions and progressives
-Staunch support for Israel could turn off progressives and Arabs, and could jeopardise the campaign in Michigan, which has a sizable Arab population


Tim Walz

Pros:
-Is from the Midwest
-Can connect with rural voters
-Repeatedly won in a conservative congressional district
-Used to be a Sergeant
-Was a high school geography teacher and football coach, and served as faculty advisor to the school's GSA
-Popular with progressives, would invigorate the base
-Has a record of achievement in Minnesota having passed laws protecting the right to choose and enacting free school meals for students
-Unexpectedly an attack dog-came up with the ""weird"" attack line
-Folksy, says it like it is, can connect with voters
-Popular with unions
-Is a governor, so could bring a different type of experience to the ticket
-Out of all contenders, has the most political experience

Cons:
-Is seen as the most progressive candidate under consideration, could turn off swing voters
-Possibly the least known of all contenders on the shortlist
-Is seen by some as a bit gruff
-In the nicest way possible, doesn't exactly radiate youth (although he's actually only six months older than Harris)
-Out of all contenders, has been in politics the longest time",1,2024-07-31 08:18:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1eglpmj/harris_vp_shortlistpros_and_cons/

-Record of bipartisanship
-Very popular in Kentucky

liberal,1eglpmj,Harris VP Shortlist-Pros and Cons,"Sorry, not sure if this is against the rules of the Subreddit (really sorry if it is), but I thought it would be fun to make a pros and cons list for each of the three candidates who appear to be in the VP shortlist: Andy Beshear, Pete Buttigieg, Mark Kelly, Josh Shapiro and Tim Walz.

 I'm not going to give my own opinion, and this list is not necessarily representative about my own opinion.

Who's ready to join for the first time?","m 40 years old this year, and while I've been politically ""involved"" for 22 years - showing up to vote, keeping tabs on politics, educating myself - I've been on the bench my whole life. Very very rarely donated, and never volunteered.

But everything is starting to change. As an LGBT man growing up in the South, it was so invigorating seeing us making serious progress over the years. If you aren't old enough to remember, a LOT of us were around for the days when being LGBT was literally illegal in over half of the county - it was 2003 when that changed. And that's just one of the major injustices I've seen overthrown in my lifetime, and I'm only 40 years old.

Now, the left is feeling beaten down. Eight years of Trump fatigue and the supreme court has been rough. But the fact of the matter is this - this election is do or die. The Republicans do not intend to EVER lose power again if they win this time around. They literally - among other things - want to eliminate thousands of federal employees and replace them with Trump loyalists. That's not opinion, that's not my take, that's what they wrote down on paper and proudly showed the world. They plan to get rid of the department of education - again, not my opinion, it's literally what they said.

So where am I going with this? Get involved. We need to get involved NOW. There are SO many ways to volunteer, and thousands have signed up, but we still have a LOT of work to do. Republicans are registering more new voters in several swing states than we are, left leaning voters are more likely to stay home and not show up, young voters especially, and turnout is always the left's biggest weak spot.

So I'm volunteering this year, for the first time in any election ever. And I'm trying to create a ripple effect of bringing people with me. Can I get three people - just three people out of all of Reddit - to commit to:

    volunteering with me in some way shape or form

    passing it on, seeking three friends to volunteer as well?

There are SO many ways to volunteer, even if you're not in a state that's up for grabs, and helping the presidential ticket also pretty much always helps down ballot and state level candidates (house, Senate, State Congress, governor, etc.) You can call and text individuals in swing states, you can help try to get people to sign up to vote (they target blue areas, don't worry), you can just reach out to people and give them a nudge that helps increase the odds of them showing up, you can do tech work!

The best thing about volunteering? It's not a job, you don't even have to put in a two week notice if you hate it and want to quit! :)

But everything is starting to change. As an LGBT man growing up in the South, it was so invigorating seeing us making serious progress over the years. If you aren't old enough to remember, a LOT of us were around for the days when being LGBT was literally illegal in over half of the county - it was 2003 when that changed. And that's just one of the major injustices I've seen overthrown in my lifetime, and I'm only 40 years old.

Now, the left is feeling beaten down. Eight years of Trump fatigue and the supreme court has been rough. But the fact of the matter is this - this election is do or die. The Republicans do not intend to EVER lose power again if they win this time around. They literally - among other things - want to eliminate thousands of federal employees and replace them with Trump loyalists. That's not opinion, that's not my take, that's what they wrote down on paper and proudly showed the world. They plan to get rid of the department of education - again, not my opinion, it's literally what they said.

So where am I going with this? Get involved. We need to get involved NOW. There are SO many ways to volunteer, and thousands have signed up, but we still have a LOT of work to do. Republicans are registering more new voters in several swing states than we are, left leaning voters are more likely to stay home and not show up, young voters especially, and turnout is always the left's biggest weak spot.

So I'm volunteering this year, for the first time in any election ever. And I'm trying to create a ripple effect of bringing people with me. Can I get three people - just three people out of all of Reddit - to commit to:

    volunteering with me in some way shape or form

    passing it on, seeking three friends to volunteer as well?

There are SO many ways to volunteer, even if you're not in a state that's up for grabs, and helping the presidential ticket also pretty much always helps down ballot and state level candidates (house, Senate, State Congress, governor, etc.) You can call and text individuals in swing states, you can help try to get people to sign up to vote (they target blue areas, don't worry), you can just reach out to people and give them a nudge that helps increase the odds of them showing up, you can do tech work!

The best thing about volunteering? It's not a job, you don't even have to put in a two week notice if you hate it and want to quit! :)

Let's get this chain going. Who's ready to roll our sleeves up and get this shit done? ",156,2024-07-29 10:29:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1ef0yng/first_time_volunteer_this_is_not_a_normal/

2. Vance is incredibly relatable to the working poor especially with the addiction in his family he faced growing up.

3. Why this guy is Republican is beyond me however he is dangerously relatable to blue collar workers and he is very young (for a politician). The fact the Teamsters showed up to the RNC also 😔 sigh

liberal,1e4s21r,Hypocrisy of the Right on Political Violence ,"Democrats like Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and President Biden have been sending messages of support, sympathy, and prayers to Donald Trump since the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania on Saturday. But how has Donald Trump himself reacted when his political opponents have faced similar threats, often from his own supporters?

Here’s what Trump said after 82-year-old Paul Pelosi, husband of the former House Democratic Speaker, had his skull fractured in October 2022 by a man who believed Trump's false election claims: ""We'll stand up to crazy Nancy Pelosi, who ruined San Francisco. How's her husband doing, by the way? Anybody know?"" He then commented on Pelosi’s opposition to the border wall, noting that the wall around her house “obviously didn’t do a very good job.”

Trump’s reaction to a far-right plot to kidnap Michigan’s Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer in August 2022 was similarly dismissive. He claimed, “The sting that they did involving Gretchen Whitmer was fake, just like those who instigated January 6.” This was despite a jury finding the two ringleaders guilty of the kidnapping plot two weeks later.

In another instance, just a week after a man who claimed to be one of Trump’s big fans was arrested for attempting to kill Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, Trump posted a video to Twitter saying, “CAIR was founded after 9/11 because they recognized that some people did something.” He repeated, “Some people did something,” a phrase many found inflammatory.

A week after one of his supporters sent a pipe bomb to Jewish billionaire George Soros’s home in 2018, Trump speculated, “I wouldn’t be surprised,” implying Soros might have staged the incident.

During the Capitol riot on January 6, 2021, as his Vice President Mike Pence was being rushed out with his family, Trump responded to chants of “Hang Mike Pence” by saying, “It’s common sense that you’re supposed to protect. If you know a vote is fraudulent, how can you pass on a fraudulent vote to Congress?”

While I am relieved that Donald Trump did not die in the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania and condemn all political violence, it is absurd for Trump supporters to lecture others on how to react to such violence given Trump’s own reactions when the threats were against Democrats or even his own Vice President.",96,2024-07-16 11:49:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1e4s21r/hypocrisy_of_the_right_on_political_violence/

liberal,1dwneh4,Misconceptions about the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling,"I’m seeing a lot of misconceptions and bad information on reddit about the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling, U.S. v. Trump.  I want to clear it up to keep the conversations on track and help people understand the claims being made about it. (If it matters, I’ve been a practicing litigation attorney for over 25 years and focus on representing governmental entities.)

The appeal came from Trump’s indictment for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.  His lawyers tried to dismiss the case, saying that presidents can’t be prosecuted for anything at least until after being impeached and convicted by Congress.  The lower courts rejected that argument. 

All nine Supreme Court Justices also rejected that argument, but six of them gave Trump even more than he asked for instead. They held that his immunity from prosecution is automatic, but tiered.  If the President is exercising powers given solely to him in the Constitution (like controlling the military and foreign affairs), the immunity is absolute.  If instead the President is doing anything else as long as it’s not clearly outside his powers — the immunity is “presumptive” rather than “absolute.”  That means the immunity can be overcome if prosecutors persuade a court on a case-by-case basis that applying a criminal prohibition wouldn’t intrude on executive authority.  Importantly, the Court said it’s not the action’s illegality or the President’s motives that matter for that question, just whether holding him to the criminal law would impede his powers.  The third tier is “unofficial acts,” which have literally no connection to his job at all, and so get no immunity. 

If the immunity does apply (either absolutely or presumptively), it means not only that criminal charges can’t be brought, but that the official act can’t even be *mentioned* in a trial on whatever non-immune acts remain.  (Justice Barrett disagreed with this last part, but a majority still made it law.) The Supreme Court said Trump’s conversations with at least some federal officers about overturning the election would definitely be absolutely immune, but sent the litigation back to the lower courts to sort out which tier of immunity might apply to the rest of his conduct. 

The ruling is extraordinary for many reasons.  First, nothing in the Constitution says anything like this, and the evidence strongly suggests that was deliberate.   Second, it dramatically exceeds the immunity all other government officials get.  Most immunity is “qualified” meaning that it’s conditioned on the official’s good faith, reasonableness, or similar limits.  This is the first time in American history a person has ever been given nearly complete license to break every law.  Third, prohibiting even the *mention* of “official acts” in any court case is not only unheard of, but totally unworkable.  As four of the Justices noted, it means a prosecution against a President for taking a bribe couldn’t tell the jury what he agreed to do in exchange.  

So when people defend this ruling by saying “officials have always had this immunity”, they’re totally wrong.  This ruling goes far beyond any kind of immunity that’s ever existed.  Also, when people defend the “official acts” requirement by saying “crime isn’t an official act,” they’re ignoring what the ruling said. The Court specifically held that the *alleged crime* isn’t the “official act” that matters, but rather the kind of government function the President was operating within when he committed it.  For example, if he accepted a bribe to sign a law, the bribe is the crime he’s immune from; the “official act” which triggers his immunity is signing legislation, which the Constitution says is one of his core powers. 

On the flipside, the ruling does not give the President any *new* powers.  So when people say “Biden should use this ruling to replace the Justices” or “to ban felons from being President,” this ruling says nothing like that.  It doesn’t put him above the law by giving him all government powers; it puts him above the law by saying when he uses his existing powers, he can commit any crime related to them.  For example, if Biden ordered the Justices arrested, it would just mean Biden couldn’t be prosecuted for having given that illegal order; it wouldn’t mean the arrests themselves would hold up in court.   But ironically, if Biden (or any President) ordered the military to assassinate the Justices, the ruling would appear to mean he couldn’t be prosecuted for it, since commanding the military is one of his core constitutional powers, and the motive and illegality of the order itself are also covered by absolute immunity.  A President could literally announce in his State of the Union address that he will sell pardons to the highest bidder, and neither the speech nor the pardons could ever be mentioned to a jury in a prosecution against him. 

This Supreme Court ruling is considered ridiculous and dangerous in nearly all legal circles.  It really does put one person above the law — and that person commands a nuclear arsenal.  It’s difficult to imagine how a President could ever be prosecuted for even the most egregious and obvious crimes, leading to outrageous abuses of his extraordinary power.  But I hope I’ve clarified what the ruling does and does not say, so that we can discuss (and rally against) it effectively.  You can read the full text of the ruling [here](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/23-939_e2pg.pdf).

liberal,1dwneh4,Misconceptions about the Supreme Court’s immunity ruling,"I’m seeing a lot of misconceptions and bad information on reddit about the Supreme Court’s presidential immunity ruling, U.S. v. Trump.  I want to clear it up to keep the conversations on track and help people understand the claims being made about it. (If it matters, I’ve been a practicing litigation attorney for over 25 years and focus on representing governmental entities.)

The appeal came from Trump’s indictment for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.  His lawyers tried to dismiss the case, saying that presidents can’t be prosecuted for anything at least until after being impeached and convicted by Congress.  The lower courts rejected that argument. 

All nine Supreme Court Justices also rejected that argument, but six of them gave Trump even more than he asked for instead. They held that his immunity from prosecution is automatic, but tiered.  If the President is exercising powers given solely to him in the Constitution (like controlling the military and foreign affairs), the immunity is absolute.  If instead the President is doing anything else as long as it’s not clearly outside his powers — the immunity is “presumptive” rather than “absolute.”  That means the immunity can be overcome if prosecutors persuade a court on a case-by-case basis that applying a criminal prohibition wouldn’t intrude on executive authority.  Importantly, the Court said it’s not the action’s illegality or the President’s motives that matter for that question, just whether holding him to the criminal law would impede his powers.  The third tier is “unofficial acts,” which have literally no connection to his job at all, and so get no immunity. 

If the immunity does apply (either absolutely or presumptively), it means not only that criminal charges can’t be brought, but that the official act can’t even be *mentioned* in a trial on whatever non-immune acts remain.  (Justice Barrett disagreed with this last part, but a majority still made it law.) The Supreme Court said Trump’s conversations with at least some federal officers about overturning the election would definitely be absolutely immune, but sent the litigation back to the lower courts to sort out which tier of immunity might apply to the rest of his conduct. 

The ruling is extraordinary for many reasons.  First, nothing in the Constitution says anything like this, and the evidence strongly suggests that was deliberate.   Second, it dramatically exceeds the immunity all other government officials get.  Most immunity is “qualified” meaning that it’s conditioned on the official’s good faith, reasonableness, or similar limits.  This is the first time in American history a person has ever been given nearly complete license to break every law.  Third, prohibiting even the *mention* of “official acts” in any court case is not only unheard of, but totally unworkable.  As four of the Justices noted, it means a prosecution against a President for taking a bribe couldn’t tell the jury what he agreed to do in exchange.  

So when people defend this ruling by saying “officials have always had this immunity”, they’re totally wrong.  This ruling goes far beyond any kind of immunity that’s ever existed.  Also, when people defend the “official acts” requirement by saying “crime isn’t an official act,” they’re ignoring what the ruling said. The Court specifically held that the *alleged crime* isn’t the “official act” that matters, but rather the kind of government function the President was operating within when he committed it.  For example, if he accepted a bribe to sign a law, the bribe is the crime he’s immune from; the “official act” which triggers his immunity is signing legislation, which the Constitution says is one of his core powers. 

On the flipside, the ruling does not give the President any *new* powers.  So when people say “Biden should use this ruling to replace the Justices” or “to ban felons from being President,” this ruling says nothing like that.  It doesn’t put him above the law by giving him all government powers; it puts him above the law by saying when he uses his existing powers, he can commit any crime related to them.  For example, if Biden ordered the Justices arrested, it would just mean Biden couldn’t be prosecuted for having given that illegal order; it wouldn’t mean the arrests themselves would hold up in court.   But ironically, if Biden (or any President) ordered the military to assassinate the Justices, the ruling would appear to mean he couldn’t be prosecuted for it, since commanding the military is one of his core constitutional powers, and the motive and illegality of the order itself are also covered by absolute immunity.  A President could literally announce in his State of the Union address that he will sell pardons to the highest bidder, and neither the speech nor the pardons could ever be mentioned to a jury in a prosecution against him. 

This Supreme Court ruling is considered ridiculous and dangerous in nearly all legal circles.  It really does put one person above the law — and that person commands a nuclear arsenal.  It’s difficult to imagine how a President could ever be prosecuted for even the most egregious and obvious crimes, leading to outrageous abuses of his extraordinary power.

If the President is exercising powers given solely to him in the Constitution (like controlling the military and foreign affairs), the immunity is absolute.  If instead the President is doing anything else as long as it’s not clearly outside his powers — the immunity is “presumptive” rather than “absolute.”  That means the immunity can be overcome if prosecutors persuade a court on a case-by-case basis that applying a criminal prohibition wouldn’t intrude on executive authority.  Importantly, the Court said it’s not the action’s illegality or the President’s motives that matter for that question, just whether holding him to the criminal law would impede his powers.  The third tier is “unofficial acts,” which have literally no connection to his job at all, and so get no immunity. 

If the immunity does apply (either absolutely or presumptively), it means not only that criminal charges can’t be brought, but that the official act can’t even be *mentioned* in a trial on whatever non-immune acts remain.  (Justice Barrett disagreed with this last part, but a majority still made it law.) The Supreme Court said Trump’s conversations with at least some federal officers about overturning the election would definitely be absolutely immune, but sent the litigation back to the lower courts to sort out which tier of immunity might apply to the rest of his conduct. 

The ruling is extraordinary for many reasons.  First, nothing in the Constitution says anything like this, and the evidence strongly suggests that was deliberate.   Second, it dramatically exceeds the immunity all other government officials get.  Most immunity is “qualified” meaning that it’s conditioned on the official’s good faith, reasonableness, or similar limits.  This is the first time in American history a person has ever been given nearly complete license to break every law.  Third, prohibiting even the *mention* of “official acts” in any court case is not only unheard of, but totally unworkable.  As four of the Justices noted, it means a prosecution against a President for taking a bribe couldn’t tell the jury what he agreed to do in exchange.  

So when people defend this ruling by saying “officials have always had this immunity”, they’re totally wrong.  This ruling goes far beyond any kind of immunity that’s ever existed.  Also, when people defend the “official acts” requirement by saying “crime isn’t an official act,” they’re ignoring what the ruling said. The Court specifically held that the *alleged crime* isn’t the “official act” that matters, but rather the kind of government function the President was operating within when he committed it.  For example, if he accepted a bribe to sign a law, the bribe is the crime he’s immune from; the “official act” which triggers his immunity is signing legislation, which the Constitution says is one of his core powers. 

On the flipside, the ruling does not give the President any *new* powers.  So when people say “Biden should use this ruling to replace the Justices” or “to ban felons from being President,” this ruling says nothing like that.  It doesn’t put him above the law by giving him all government powers; it puts him above the law by saying when he uses his existing powers, he can commit any crime related to them.  For example, if Biden ordered the Justices arrested, it would just mean Biden couldn’t be prosecuted for having given that illegal order; it wouldn’t mean the arrests themselves would hold up in court.   But ironically, if Biden (or any President) ordered the military to assassinate the Justices, the ruling would appear to mean he couldn’t be prosecuted for it, since commanding the military is one of his core constitutional powers, and the motive and illegality of the order itself are also covered by absolute immunity.  A President could literally announce in his State of the Union address that he will sell pardons to the highest bidder, and neither the speech nor the pardons could ever be mentioned to a jury in a prosecution against him. 

This Supreme Court ruling is considered ridiculous and dangerous in nearly all legal circles.  It really does put one person above the law — and that person commands a nuclear arsenal.  It’s difficult to imagine how a President could ever be prosecuted for even the most egregious and obvious crimes, leading to outrageous abuses of his extraordinary power.  But I hope I’ve clarified what the ruling does and does not say, so that we can discuss (and rally against) it effectively.

liberal,1dv8bj6,Slacktivism and the election,"Like many of you I'm sure, my days since the debate have been filled with a dark sense of foreboding. I think the debate crystallized something that I already knew, which is that this election may very well be lost. Maybe likely lost.

And yet, I also notice a major contradiction in my actions:  I'm not doing anything about it.

Of course I will vote for whoever the Democratic nominee is.  But beyond that, I have no concrete plans to do anything about it.

I want to remind everyone that arguing and discussing things on Reddit, Facebook, etc. isn't doing anything about it. Throwing the Democrats a few bucks isn't doing anything about it. If you can do it on the toilet, it doesn't count.

Doing politics -- that is, getting people to vote or change their vote -- is really, really hard, boring, unrewarding work. Doing something about it involves sacrifices of time -- free time -- and energy and lots of money. Travel.  Inter-state travel. Sacrifice that might affect your job, your video game time, your time with kids, your hobbies, your exercise regimen. Sacrifice day in and day out, not just one-offs.

I say this as someone who, at the moment, can't be bothered to do much more than vote. So, I guess I'm admitting that things aren't *so* bad that I'm going to do anything about it.

How bad do things need to get before I start sacrificing time and energy to effect change?  I don't know. But I do know, that if I look at myself in the mirror and am honest, I'm not going to do anything else.  I don't know what this really means.

To these ""what can I do about it posts,"" we all know the answer.  It's boring stuff like volunteer for campaigns, join advocacy groups, attend local government meetings, engage in protests, community projects, educate on policy issues, run for office, boycott misaligned businesses, and so on.  And I'm not going to do any of that, if I'm honest.  Not a chance.  Not now, anyway.

Please forgive the rambling -- but my point is this: don't kid yourself.  Posting on Reddit and arguing with anonymous internet people isn't going to change the outcome.  If you're scared, like I am, then ask yourself why you're not doing more.  If you figure it out, please let me know.

And yet, I also notice a major contradiction in my actions:  I'm not doing anything about it.

Of course I will vote for whoever the Democratic nominee is.  But beyond that, I have no concrete plans to do anything about it.

Doing politics -- that is, getting people to vote or change their vote -- is really, really hard, boring, unrewarding work. Doing something about it involves sacrifices of time -- free time -- and energy and lots of money. Travel.  Inter-state travel. Sacrifice that might affect your job, your video game time, your time with kids, your hobbies, your exercise regimen. Sacrifice day in and day out, not just one-offs.

I say this as someone who, at the moment, can't be bothered to do much more than vote. So, I guess I'm admitting that things aren't *so* bad that I'm going to do anything about it.

How bad do things need to get before I start sacrificing time and energy to effect change?  I don't know. But I do know, that if I look at myself in the mirror and am honest, I'm not going to do anything else.  I don't know what this really means.

Doing something about it involves sacrifices of time -- free time -- and energy and lots of money. Travel.  Inter-state travel. Sacrifice that might affect your job, your video game time, your time with kids, your hobbies, your exercise regimen. Sacrifice day in and day out, not just one-offs.

I say this as someone who, at the moment, can't be bothered to do much more than vote. So, I guess I'm admitting that things aren't *so* bad that I'm going to do anything about it.

How bad do things need to get before I start sacrificing time and energy to effect change?  I don't know. But I do know, that if I look at myself in the mirror and am honest, I'm not going to do anything else.  I don't know what this really means.

To these ""what can I do about it posts,"" we all know the answer.  It's boring stuff like volunteer for campaigns, join advocacy groups, attend local government meetings, engage in protests, community projects, educate on policy issues, run for office, boycott misaligned businesses, and so on.  And I'm not going to do any of that, if I'm honest.  Not a chance.  Not now, anyway.

Please forgive the rambling -- but my point is this: don't kid yourself.  Posting on Reddit and arguing with anonymous internet people isn't going to change the outcome.  If you're scared, like I am, then ask yourself why you're not doing more.  If you figure it out, please let me know.   Because I am more scared now than I've ever been, and I'm still not doing shit.",9,2024-07-04 10:31:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1dv8bj6/slacktivism_and_the_election/

Of course I will vote for whoever the Democratic nominee is.  But beyond that, I have no concrete plans to do anything about it.

liberal,1c2j8ej,Supply And Demand,"Had a debate with a coworker. He was angry as to why when during high demand seasons hotels increase the prices of rooms and not just keep it at a fixed price all year? Told him that it is to maximize profits which can go into things like bonuses for workers, upkeep and improvements for the hotel. This with the fact that if they were kept low all year the availability for a room would almost never be there as they would be bough almost immediately which would lead to a new problem.

Also he complained why McDonalds had to raise prices since they raised wages. Couldn’t they just absorb the blow? “Instead of 3 yachts why not just 2?” I brought up that the cost of wages went up to balance and with that there’d usually be layoffs or an increase in the price of goods or both.

I’m not a econ wiz, more comp sci but am I off? Are there any better points I could have made?

liberal,1c2e028,Anti women propaganda and whitewashing the past ,"
TLDR:  propagandists are rewriting the past about misogyny -  denying it happened.  

I'm shell shocked,  pretty upset after decades of working so hard for equal rights, I'm seeing them implode in one generation. 

I am a het male, but I was defending trans women,  and once you post links to facts and studies and  people refuse to accept, there's no where to go. I give up. 

So I asked the commenter to at least remember, years back when women wanted to be called Ms. ( No one's business if they are single), demanded credit in their own name, demanded equal pay, complained about the glass ceiling, denial of reproductive  health care, about not being allowed in certain jobs, etc.  people back then seriously rolled their eyes, demeaned women,  harassed and assaulted them for demanding equal rights.

There were even women who took the side of men and ranted that feminists should shut up,  stay home with the kids, stop destroying men's lives by taking away men's rights ...  

 They talked about them in the same way people talk about marginalized people today. 

As we can all agree now, they were on the wrong side of history.  

Except the redditor responded angrily by calling bullshit on my rendition of the past. They said it was third wave feminism ( no clue what that is). 

And then the kicker - they said that women not getting paid the same was a MYTH. 

WTF. A Myth! 

I was there. I was alive then. My sisters were alive then and they lived it. They are still alive and can attest to it, as can many other women. This shit happened. 

Misogyny was rampant. 

There were actually child raising books that warned parents  to not allow their daughter's expectations to get too high, don't give them too much education or their daughters would be upset and depressed when in the end they would just be stay at home moms. 

I had friends who screamed with frustration because they wanted to be architects or scientists  and they were shuttled to ""interior decorating"". 

And yes, I had sisters who were paid less than their male counterparts.

 I remember news show debates where it was explained that men are the breadwinners and women left the workforce to get pregnant anyway, so that was why men were paid more. 

These things HAPPENED.  They are real. I am not making them up. 

This is like serious Holocaust denial type BS. Like Florida under Desantis teaching that there are upsides to slavery for slaves BS. 

I googled and found out there is actually a movement to diminish the heinous misogyny that women suffered in the past.  This person who denied my take on history says she is a woman in her 30s. She may not be, maybe she is some male who is pining for the good old days.  I have no idea. 

But I'm disgusted. Something terrible is happening. Brave New World Dystopian Gilead terrible.  

Is there some Jordan Peterson for women Tik Tok? No idea. But it didn't take long to revert. Between the denial of history and trump and an 1864 abortion law resurrection, I'm beginning to think like water seeking its own level humans gravitate toward authoritarianism. I wonder if Democracy and the dream of equal rights was just a blip. 

I had to let it out somewhere. I had to say something.  So I wrote about it here. Hoping folks can tell me it ain't so bad.

Is there some Jordan Peterson for women Tik Tok? No idea. But it didn't take long to revert. Between the denial of history and trump and an 1864 abortion law resurrection, I'm beginning to think like water seeking its own level humans gravitate toward authoritarianism. I wonder if Democracy and the dream of equal rights was just a blip. 

I had to let it out somewhere. I had to say something.  So I wrote about it here. Hoping folks can tell me it ain't so bad.

TLDR:  propagandists are rewriting the past about misogyny -  denying it happened.  

I'm shell shocked,  pretty upset after decades of working so hard for equal rights, I'm seeing them implode in one generation. 

I am a het male, but I was defending trans women,  and once you post links to facts and studies and  people refuse to accept, there's no where to go. I give up. 

So I asked the commenter to at least remember, years back when women wanted to be called Ms. ( No one's business if they are single), demanded credit in their own name, demanded equal pay, complained about the glass ceiling, denial of reproductive  health care, about not being allowed in certain jobs, etc.  people back then seriously rolled their eyes, demeaned women,  harassed and assaulted them for demanding equal rights.

There were even women who took the side of men and ranted that feminists should shut up,  stay home with the kids, stop destroying men's lives by taking away men's rights ...  

 They talked about them in the same way people talk about marginalized people today. 

As we can all agree now, they were on the wrong side of history.  

Except the redditor responded angrily by calling bullshit on my rendition of the past. They said it was third wave feminism ( no clue what that is). 

And then the kicker - they said that women not getting paid the same was a MYTH. 

WTF. A Myth! 

I was there. I was alive then. My sisters were alive then and they lived it. They are still alive and can attest to it, as can many other women. This shit happened. 

Misogyny was rampant. 

There were actually child raising books that warned parents  to not allow their daughter's expectations to get too high, don't give them too much education or their daughters would be upset and depressed when in the end they would just be stay at home moms. 

I had friends who screamed with frustration because they wanted to be architects or scientists  and they were shuttled to ""interior decorating"". 

And yes, I had sisters who were paid less than their male counterparts.

 I remember news show debates where it was explained that men are the breadwinners and women left the workforce to get pregnant anyway, so that was why men were paid more. 

These things HAPPENED.  They are real. I am not making them up. 

This is like serious Holocaust denial type BS. Like Florida under Desantis teaching that there are upsides to slavery for slaves BS.

liberal,1c2e028,Anti women propaganda and whitewashing the past ,"
TLDR:  propagandists are rewriting the past about misogyny -  denying it happened.  

I'm shell shocked,  pretty upset after decades of working so hard for equal rights, I'm seeing them implode in one generation. 

I am a het male, but I was defending trans women,  and once you post links to facts and studies and  people refuse to accept, there's no where to go. I give up. 

So I asked the commenter to at least remember, years back when women wanted to be called Ms. ( No one's business if they are single), demanded credit in their own name, demanded equal pay, complained about the glass ceiling, denial of reproductive  health care, about not being allowed in certain jobs, etc.  people back then seriously rolled their eyes, demeaned women,  harassed and assaulted them for demanding equal rights.

There were even women who took the side of men and ranted that feminists should shut up,  stay home with the kids, stop destroying men's lives by taking away men's rights ...  

 They talked about them in the same way people talk about marginalized people today. 

As we can all agree now, they were on the wrong side of history.  

Except the redditor responded angrily by calling bullshit on my rendition of the past. They said it was third wave feminism ( no clue what that is). 

And then the kicker - they said that women not getting paid the same was a MYTH. 

WTF. A Myth! 

I was there. I was alive then. My sisters were alive then and they lived it. They are still alive and can attest to it, as can many other women. This shit happened. 

Misogyny was rampant. 

There were actually child raising books that warned parents  to not allow their daughter's expectations to get too high, don't give them too much education or their daughters would be upset and depressed when in the end they would just be stay at home moms. 

I had friends who screamed with frustration because they wanted to be architects or scientists  and they were shuttled to ""interior decorating"". 

And yes, I had sisters who were paid less than their male counterparts.

 I remember news show debates where it was explained that men are the breadwinners and women left the workforce to get pregnant anyway, so that was why men were paid more. 

These things HAPPENED.  They are real. I am not making them up. 

This is like serious Holocaust denial type BS. Like Florida under Desantis teaching that there are upsides to slavery for slaves BS. 

I googled and found out there is actually a movement to diminish the heinous misogyny that women suffered in the past.  This person who denied my take on history says she is a woman in her 30s. She may not be, maybe she is some male who is pining for the good old days.  I have no idea. 

But I'm disgusted. Something terrible is happening. Brave New World Dystopian Gilead terrible.  

Is there some Jordan Peterson for women Tik Tok? No idea. But it didn't take long to revert. Between the denial of history and trump and an 1864 abortion law resurrection, I'm beginning to think like water seeking its own level humans gravitate toward authoritarianism. I wonder if Democracy and the dream of equal rights was just a blip. 

I had to let it out somewhere. I had to say something.  So I wrote about it here. Hoping folks can tell me it ain't so bad.

liberal,1bz78f2,Time to get smart as buyers,"I’ve been thinking a lot about how to get the most bang for my buck in terms of social and systemic change for a more fair and just society. My wife and I are regular donors to both scientific research projects as well as public charitable events and organizations. But I’ve come to the escapable conclusion that these acts are a misallocation of capital.

I’ve come to the conclusion that it’s far cheaper and much more cost-effective to just buy the politicians that we need. Now I’m not advocating that we do anything illegal or even follow the footsteps of citizens united by setting up complex SuperPACs, rather, we just go back to basic organizational discipline and organize the party the way it organized in the past - we pick and back candidates to win in races that matter.

What candidates? The ones who commit to taxing billionaires to pay for universal healthcare, a more fair maternity and parental leave system, a more just judiciary, etc. I’d humbly suggest we tell folks who think the order of operations is [Ideology leads to Policy] and not [Policy is based on effectiveness and we derive Ideology from patterns of success] to step aside and we focus on school boards, city councils but most importantly Congressional districts with an effort to put all our energy behind a slate of imperfect candidates all committed to perfecting an evidence and outcome based approach to government. 

This also means campaigning on actually solving problems, something that is inherently local. I was once driving in Kentucky where my wife is from and the road we were on was perfectly flat and smooth. I made a comment on how it must have been recently paved and she said, “Oh, yeah, someone’s running for re-election” in a matter of fact tone. I asked her what she meant and she explained, “It doesn’t matter if you are a democrat or a republican around here, they re-elect the guy who fixes the roads and gets jobs to come here.”

It's Nothing but promoting Putin's nuclear blackmail so people will vote for Trump.  I refuse to believe Putin is that stupid and would destroy the world over some planes or troops in Ukraine. He's crazy but I don't think he's suicidal. But posting those articles gives Putin exactly what he wants. Especially by wording it to make it seem like it's Putin himself saying it when it's just a low level stooge or puppet.

Off topic but how come in google trending it's always ""russia ukraine war russian"" do people not know how to just search for ""Russian-Ukraine war""?",74,2024-03-31 11:43:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1bsde74/newsweek_needs_to_stop_giving_putin_attention/
liberal,1bsd1y4,Woman Who Was Charged With Murder After Abortion Sues Texas Prosecutor,"[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/30/us/texas-abortion-murder-charge-lawsuit.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/30/us/texas-abortion-murder-charge-lawsuit.html)

The anti-abortionists accomplished a major coup simply by legitimizing the question of if women should be allowed to have abortions - because what is really being asked is if women should be allowed to control their own bodies. It's about time someone took their misogyny to court.  Hitting them in the wallet is the only thing conservatives respect.

No brain = no person. This is the undeniable biological scientific FACT that anti-abortionists dance and contort to deny, but no matter how they hope and wish and pray and fantasize is NEVER going away. To think otherwise is textbook magical thinking.

99% of abortions are done before 21 weeks, but anti-abortionists are constantly acting like every abortion happens minutes before labor begins. That is an outright LIE, designed to evoke a visceral sympathetic reaction, just like the outright LIE that a brainless lump of cells should be granted bodily autonomy by STEALING it from the real actual aware conscious woman. Anti-abortionists promote these LIES because they know the truth is inadaquate to support their cause, but they DESPERATELY want to 'save babies' and they don't care whose life they have to take to do it. A fetus doesn't even get close to the sophistication necessary for awareness until the third trimester, but nobody has an unnecessary abortion in the third trimester anyway, so that isn't what this is about.

The entire anti-abortion movement is based on obfuscation and lies. That is the truth. It is just another wing of the conservative Busybody Gestapo seeking to run people's lives and imagine they're heroes for doing it - but anybody with any intelligence sees right through their cruel self-serving delusions.

In any case, no one is required to light themselves on fire to warm another, EVER - but if you think someone should, feel free to light yourself.",159,2024-03-31 11:28:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1bsd1y4/woman_who_was_charged_with_murder_after_abortion/

liberal,1bhqnwm,Supreme Court of USA brings back slavery in making women 2nd class citizens.,"Just as we had states that allowed owning people and those who did not we now have a country where women are in essence 'owned' by the State in some states. If a woman does not have self autonomy, if part of her body is controlled by the state then she does not have the freedom that a man has. This is pure and simple slavery. The moment she can reproduce until the moment that is no longer possible part of her body is no longer hers which means her life itself is not longer hers.

Sure it is not as horrific and when people were bought and sold, treated as cattle but tell that to the 12 year old child, raped by her father who is now forced to risk her health and life and give birth to her sister. Tell that to the poor who cannot travel out of state, lose the low paying job they have and then not have enough food to feed the child that is born. There were 'treasured' slaves that were treated as part of the 'family'. Does that make slavery in the south for hundreds of years better?

This is not a comparison of which is better or worse. It is a simple statement that the Supreme Court of America has brought state optioned slavery back to the country.

Edit: So slavery was definitely the wrong word to use but I am unable to find the right word to show that the civil war is still going on and the ""States Rights"" is a tool for giving some people less rights than others.  As I said or tried to get across, for most cases this is not as horrific as slavery but it has the same theme of a flawed system where rights can be taken away and if you look at where women are losing their rights it sure does map well with the slave states of pre-civil war era.

I am going to repeat a comment I made to another

""Being the OP I will butt in here. No, I was in no way trying to say that what is happening today is equivalent to the slavery that occurred with people ripped from their homes, family and country to be turned into 'cattle' in another country. NO way in hell is that equivalent to women having their body autonomy taken from them. However slavery is not a term to be used only to represent one instance of it. I said as much when I say ""it is not as horrific as"" though there are instances where it can be. That does not make it the same. Slavery was once the norm of the world. It is only recently that women have been given equal rights at all in the Western world and much of the rest of it. Yes, women who are beautiful have always been treated as pampered pets and many women are quite satisfied with it. That is not the point. The point is that without body autonomy women are not free and they are not equal citizens. You can certainly say, ""hey, it isn't a bad life"" and many will agree with you including a large percentage of women. That does not take away what I was trying to say which is the Supreme Court has given us back a country where states can decide who is free and who is not.""",88,2024-03-18 09:25:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1bhqnwm/supreme_court_of_usa_brings_back_slavery_in/

The moment she can reproduce until the moment that is no longer possible part of her body is no longer hers which means her life itself is not longer hers.

Sure it is not as horrific and when people were bought and sold, treated as cattle but tell that to the 12 year old child, raped by her father who is now forced to risk her health and life and give birth to her sister. Tell that to the poor who cannot travel out of state, lose the low paying job they have and then not have enough food to feed the child that is born. There were 'treasured' slaves that were treated as part of the 'family'. Does that make slavery in the south for hundreds of years better?

This is not a comparison of which is better or worse. It is a simple statement that the Supreme Court of America has brought state optioned slavery back to the country.

Edit: So slavery was definitely the wrong word to use but I am unable to find the right word to show that the civil war is still going on and the ""States Rights"" is a tool for giving some people less rights than others.  As I said or tried to get across, for most cases this is not as horrific as slavery but it has the same theme of a flawed system where rights can be taken away and if you look at where women are losing their rights it sure does map well with the slave states of pre-civil war era.

I am going to repeat a comment I made to another

""Being the OP I will butt in here. No, I was in no way trying to say that what is happening today is equivalent to the slavery that occurred with people ripped from their homes, family and country to be turned into 'cattle' in another country. NO way in hell is that equivalent to women having their body autonomy taken from them. However slavery is not a term to be used only to represent one instance of it. I said as much when I say ""it is not as horrific as"" though there are instances where it can be. That does not make it the same. Slavery was once the norm of the world. It is only recently that women have been given equal rights at all in the Western world and much of the rest of it. Yes, women who are beautiful have always been treated as pampered pets and many women are quite satisfied with it. That is not the point. The point is that without body autonomy women are not free and they are not equal citizens. You can certainly say, ""hey, it isn't a bad life"" and many will agree with you including a large percentage of women. That does not take away what I was trying to say which is the Supreme Court has given us back a country where states can decide who is free and who is not.""",88,2024-03-18 09:25:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1bhqnwm/supreme_court_of_usa_brings_back_slavery_in/

liberal,1b3hdkg,What is the deal with Republican Conservatives? ,"I know it seems like a pretty inflammatory question at first glance, but I’m seriously interested in understanding exactly what they see for themselves in the future with the road they’re on.

So… are they trying to be tyrants, push for fascism, destroying human rights and liberties and freedoms? If so, they’re as far from good as they could get. And if Nazi Germany taught us anything, there’s no removing scars like that. Those scars are permanent for the country that has them. 

Are they just hateful of Left-Wingers? If that’s the case, that kind of goes against the whole “unity” thing and it explains why we’re so divided and unable to man our military. 

Why can’t Right-Wingers understand that if the Left wing goes down, we all go down? Why can’t they accept that they CAN’T make a future off of hate and spite alone? That they actually need to do their jobs and give us something actually worth caring about? And no, Trump’s not good enough. Just because they *think* he’s great, doesn’t mean he is. It just means they’re stupid enough to believe those lies. 

They only seem to be a party of people who think violence and bigotry are great. It’s hard to work around everything else. Like, the amount of legal loopholes they gotta weave to be able to call themselves the party of “family values” or “big business” are laughable at best and insane at worst. If they think massive inflation and tax hikes for the poor fits the definition of big business and mass shootings and taking children away from immigrant families is the definition of family values, well… then it’s quite obvious why nobody good or reasonable is subscribing to their party. 

I don’t think they have the ability to justify their own party anymore. Nor their future. A country led by them is… not America. That’s putting it lightly. ",155,2024-02-29 20:13:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1b3hdkg/what_is_the_deal_with_republican_conservatives/

I don’t think they have the ability to justify their own party anymore. Nor their future. A country led by them is… not America. That’s putting it lightly. ",155,2024-02-29 20:13:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/Liberal/comments/1b3hdkg/what_is_the_deal_with_republican_conservatives/
liberal,1b3hdkg,What is the deal with Republican Conservatives? ,"I know it seems like a pretty inflammatory question at first glance, but I’m seriously interested in understanding exactly what they see for themselves in the future with the road they’re on.

So… are they trying to be tyrants, push for fascism, destroying human rights and liberties and freedoms? If so, they’re as far from good as they could get. And if Nazi Germany taught us anything, there’s no removing scars like that. Those scars are permanent for the country that has them. 

Are they just hateful of Left-Wingers? If that’s the case, that kind of goes against the whole “unity” thing and it explains why we’re so divided and unable to man our military. 

Why can’t Right-Wingers understand that if the Left wing goes down, we all go down? Why can’t they accept that they CAN’T make a future off of hate and spite alone? That they actually need to do their jobs and give us something actually worth caring about? And no, Trump’s not good enough. Just because they *think* he’s great, doesn’t mean he is. It just means they’re stupid enough to believe those lies. 

They only seem to be a party of people who think violence and bigotry are great. It’s hard to work around everything else. Like, the amount of legal loopholes they gotta weave to be able to call themselves the party of “family values” or “big business” are laughable at best and insane at worst.

* Jobs that companies don't intend to fill, but they leave out there in case a unicorn applies.
* Jobs for compliance-based positions (i.e. cybersecurity) that are only out there so that the CEO can say ""we tried to hire someone, but couldn't find anyone qualified"" if there's a breach.

Specifically looking at cybersecurity, there's supposedly 500,000 unfilled jobs in the US and a severe labor shortage in the industry.  Yet, I've applied for hundreds of jobs and gotten 1 interview.  This seems to be common across the industry (for example looking at posts and comments I see on IT and cybersecurity subreddits, which suggest a lot of folks are churning out applications and getting zilch).

I'm curious to the libertarian perspective on ghost jobs.  Is this something that should be part of the freedom of a privately-owned business to exercise as they see fit?  Or is this the kind of thing that should be considered fraud and therefore job searchers should be protected against?",38,2024-11-30 18:14:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1h3p42y/what_is_the_libertarian_position_on_ghost_jobs/

Libertarian,1h0sh2z,Cave Karl and the Communist Manifesto,"In the heart of a smoky, dimly lit cave, the tribe gathered around their most learned caveman, Cave Karl. Armed with a stick for a pen and a particularly flat rock for a desk, he grunted and gestured with great enthusiasm. 

Onlookers were skeptical but curious; after all, Cave Karl had recently invented “thinking,” and it had already caused quite a stir.

“Ug! Why some have big mammoth, others only puny rabbit?” Cave Karl bellowed, thumping his stick against the cave wall. “It unfair! Mammoth belong to all!”

The crowd murmured in agreement. Big Thag, the richest caveman in the tribe (and owner of at least three mammoth carcasses), frowned and crossed his arms.

“But me hunt mammoth! Me use big rock! Me earn mammoth!” Big Thag retorted.

Cave Karl pointed his stick accusingly. “But you no hunt alone! Small Zog help throw spear. Old Grug scare mammoth with fire. And me, Cave Karl, provide moral support by saying ‘Good job!’ Mammoth no just yours. Mammoth belong to collective!”

Small Zog, always feeling underappreciated, clapped his hands. “Yeah! Zog only get mammoth feet! Tastes like dirt!”

Big Thag rolled his eyes. “If Zog no like feet, Zog hunt own mammoth!”

This incensed Cave Karl. “Aha! You prove point! System broken! It mammoth-eat-mammoth world out there. No fairness. No sharing. No solidarity! We need new system: Communalism—wait, no—COMMUNISM!”

The crowd gasped. Someone in the back muttered, “What communism?”

Cave Karl puffed out his chest. “Communism simple. No one own anything. All belong to tribe. Mammoth? Tribe. Fire? Tribe. Sharpest rock? Tribe. Even Thag’s fancy bone necklace? Tribe!”

Thag clutched his necklace in horror. “But this MY necklace! My grandma chew bone for hours to make smooth!”

“Grandma chew for tribe!” Cave Karl countered. “Necklace not yours! Necklace symbolic of capitalist greed!”

Another caveman piped up. “But if no one own anything, why me bother hunt mammoth at all? Why not just sit and eat berries?”

Cave Karl wagged his stick. “Under communism, tribe share EVERYTHING, including mammoth and berries. If you no hunt, you help another way—like, uh, drawing pretty pictures on cave walls or sharpening spears!”

“But what if I just nap all day?” asked Lazy Ugg, scratching his armpit.

Cave Karl hesitated for a moment but quickly recovered. “Then… you napping for tribe! Tribe benefit from well-rested member!”

This was met with much applause. Lazy Ugg smiled, his revolutionary spirit suddenly awakened.

---

#Implementation of Communism

The next day, Cave Karl led a redistribution effort. He declared that Big Thag’s three mammoth carcasses must be divided equally among all 20 members of the tribe. 

The problem arose when everyone showed up to collect their share. By the time the 20th person arrived, there was nothing left but a single mammoth tooth.

“Where mammoth?” cried Small Zog.

“Ah,” Cave Karl explained, “distribution difficult. Mammoth heavy. Mammoth also rot. But not problem! We make new rule: Everyone eat equal share of imaginary mammoth!”

“Imaginary mammoth?!” Big Thag bellowed. “Me starving! Tribe starving! Where real food?”

“No need for mammoth under communism!” Cave Karl declared triumphantly. “We grow berry farm! But all must help, or else no berries.”

Naturally, Lazy Ugg claimed he was already contributing by napping. Small Zog sharpened sticks but promptly poked himself in the foot and had to sit out. Old Grug wandered off, muttering something about “back in my day.” 

By evening, the berry farm had yielded exactly one berry.

Cave Karl bit into it dramatically. “Mmm… taste of equality.”

---

#Collapse of the System

By the end of the week, the tribe was in disarray. Big Thag had fled to start his own capitalist tribe where he promised “mammoth for every man.” 

Cave Karl, however, remained undeterred. “Failure no fault of communism,” he declared to the five remaining tribe members. “Fault of Thag, Zog, and… uh… weather! Next time, we do better. Need only true believers!”

As the tribe starved around him, Cave Karl began sketching new plans on the cave wall: “Dictatorship of the Pebbletariat.”

---

#Rise of the Pebbletariat

Cave Karl’s new plan was genius—or so he thought. He declared that instead of everyone owning everything equally (since that had gone terribly wrong), power would now rest in the hands of a single, enlightened leader: himself, naturally.

 “Cave Karl not selfish,” he insisted. “Cave Karl only lead until tribe ready for true communism. Then tribe lead itself! Very simple!”

To ensure fairness, Cave Karl introduced the concept of the Pebbletariat, where each member of the tribe was given a special pebble. The more pebbles you contributed to the communal pile, the more say you had in tribal matters. 

This was, of course, revolutionary since Cave Karl happened to have a massive collection of pebbles he’d secretly hoarded over the years.

“But if Karl have most pebbles, then Karl control everything!” Old Grug pointed out.

“Exactly! Very efficient!” Cave Karl replied, slapping his stick on the ground for emphasis. “One leader mean no arguments, no mistakes, and no Thag stealing mammoth!”

---

#Pebble Problems

At first, the system seemed to work. The tribe began bringing pebbles to Karl, who redistributed them as he saw fit. Lazy Ugg offered his pebble in exchange for a nap exemption. 

Small Zog traded his pebble for a slightly bigger pebble. 

Old Grug gave up his pebble under protest but grumbled loudly about Karl being a “rock hoarder.”

However, soon problems arose. Some cavemen started forging counterfeit pebbles out of clay. A black market emerged, where sharp sticks and mammoth teeth were traded for “rare” striped pebbles. 

Small Zog got caught trying to smuggle a whole sack of rocks from a nearby riverbed.

“This treason!” Cave Karl roared when he discovered the scheme. “Pebble system only work if everyone follow rules! Zog, you enemy of the Pebbletariat!”

Zog, shaking with fear, stammered, “But me only want bigger say in tribe! Is that not the point of system?”

“Point of system,” Karl corrected, “is to do what I say! Now Zog banished to Riverbank Gulag!”

---

#Breadline Blues

With Zog out of the picture, Cave Karl turned his attention to the food supply, which was at an all-time low. He introduced a new program: “Five Mammoth Plan.” The goal? Catch five mammoths in five days.

“How we do that?” asked Lazy Ugg, who was now in charge of logistics because no one else wanted the job.

“Simple,” Karl replied. “Everyone work twice as hard!”

“But no one catch even one mammoth last week!” Ugg protested. “How catch five?”

Karl sighed dramatically. “That because tribe lazy! Under Pebbletariat leadership, we motivated by shared vision of prosperity!”

Inspired by Karl’s stirring speech, the tribe set out with renewed energy… and promptly failed to catch a single mammoth. 

By the end of Day Five, they had managed to kill a very angry squirrel and burn down part of the forest after an ill-advised fire experiment.

“This not failure!” Karl announced to the exhausted tribe. “This… pre-success! Five Mammoth Plan still possible with more discipline. All need is faith in system.”

---

#Revolt of the Exiles

While Karl struggled to keep his shrinking tribe from collapsing, news reached them of Big Thag’s capitalist splinter group. 

Thag’s tribe was thriving. Rumors spread of huge mammoth feasts, shiny tools, and something called “private housing.” 

Worse, Big Thag was allegedly trading surplus mammoth meat to a third group led by Small Zog, who had apparently turned Riverbank Gulag into a bustling free market economy.

“Thag and Zog traitors!” Karl shouted when he heard the news. “They exploit tribe with greed and selfishness! We must crush counter-revolution!”

Karl gathered the remaining members of his tribe—Lazy Ugg, Old Grug, and a confused child who had wandered into the cave looking for berries. 

Armed with sticks and righteous fury, they marched toward Thag’s camp, determined to reclaim the mammoth meat in the name of the Pebbletariat.

---

#The Final Showdown

When Karl’s ragged crew arrived at Thag’s camp, they were stunned. Thag’s tribe lived in clean, organized huts. Mammoth ribs roasted over open fires. Children played with toys carved from bones. Thag himself lounged on a throne made of polished rocks.

“Cave Karl!” Thag bellowed when he saw them. “What bring you here? Need food? Or just here to complain?”

Karl ignored him. “This prosperity built on lies! Mammoth meat stolen from collective! We demand redistribution!”

Thag laughed. “Why should me share with you? You no hunt. You no help. You only shout and wave stick!”

Karl turned to his companions for backup. “See? Proof of oppression! We fight for justice! For equality! For—wait, where everyone go?”

He spun around to find Lazy Ugg happily munching on a mammoth leg and Old Grug negotiating a trade for one of Thag’s shiny rocks. Even the confused child had abandoned him in favor of the roasted squirrel skewers.

Karl fell to his knees, shaking his stick at the sky. “Ungrateful fools! You doom tribe! Without communism, you descend into chaos! Into… oh, is that mammoth stew?”

---

#Epilogue

Cave Karl eventually joined Thag’s tribe, though he insisted on calling himself a “consultant.” His ideas were occasionally useful—like inventing the wheel—but most of the time, he just sat in the corner, muttering about “inevitable revolution.”

As for communism? It was officially declared extinct after the disastrous “Two Pebble Policy.” But every so often, someone would hear Karl grumbling about “proletariat uprising” and laugh. After all, there was plenty of mammoth for everyone.

Cave Karl, however, remained undeterred. “Failure no fault of communism,” he declared to the five remaining tribe members. “Fault of Thag, Zog, and… uh… weather! Next time, we do better. Need only true believers!”

As the tribe starved around him, Cave Karl began sketching new plans on the cave wall: “Dictatorship of the Pebbletariat.”

---

#Rise of the Pebbletariat

Cave Karl’s new plan was genius—or so he thought. He declared that instead of everyone owning everything equally (since that had gone terribly wrong), power would now rest in the hands of a single, enlightened leader: himself, naturally.

 “Cave Karl not selfish,” he insisted. “Cave Karl only lead until tribe ready for true communism. Then tribe lead itself! Very simple!”

To ensure fairness, Cave Karl introduced the concept of the Pebbletariat, where each member of the tribe was given a special pebble. The more pebbles you contributed to the communal pile, the more say you had in tribal matters. 

This was, of course, revolutionary since Cave Karl happened to have a massive collection of pebbles he’d secretly hoarded over the years.

“But if Karl have most pebbles, then Karl control everything!” Old Grug pointed out.

“Exactly! Very efficient!” Cave Karl replied, slapping his stick on the ground for emphasis. “One leader mean no arguments, no mistakes, and no Thag stealing mammoth!”

---

#Pebble Problems

At first, the system seemed to work. The tribe began bringing pebbles to Karl, who redistributed them as he saw fit. Lazy Ugg offered his pebble in exchange for a nap exemption. 

Small Zog traded his pebble for a slightly bigger pebble. 

Old Grug gave up his pebble under protest but grumbled loudly about Karl being a “rock hoarder.”

However, soon problems arose. Some cavemen started forging counterfeit pebbles out of clay. A black market emerged, where sharp sticks and mammoth teeth were traded for “rare” striped pebbles. 

Small Zog got caught trying to smuggle a whole sack of rocks from a nearby riverbed.

“This treason!” Cave Karl roared when he discovered the scheme. “Pebble system only work if everyone follow rules! Zog, you enemy of the Pebbletariat!”

Zog, shaking with fear, stammered, “But me only want bigger say in tribe! Is that not the point of system?”

“Point of system,” Karl corrected, “is to do what I say! Now Zog banished to Riverbank Gulag!”

---

#Breadline Blues

With Zog out of the picture, Cave Karl turned his attention to the food supply, which was at an all-time low. He introduced a new program: “Five Mammoth Plan.” The goal? Catch five mammoths in five days.

“How we do that?” asked Lazy Ugg, who was now in charge of logistics because no one else wanted the job.

“Simple,” Karl replied. “Everyone work twice as hard!”

“But no one catch even one mammoth last week!” Ugg protested. “How catch five?”

Karl sighed dramatically. “That because tribe lazy! Under Pebbletariat leadership, we motivated by shared vision of prosperity!”

Inspired by Karl’s stirring speech, the tribe set out with renewed energy… and promptly failed to catch a single mammoth. 

By the end of Day Five, they had managed to kill a very angry squirrel and burn down part of the forest after an ill-advised fire experiment.

“This not failure!” Karl announced to the exhausted tribe. “This… pre-success! Five Mammoth Plan still possible with more discipline. All need is faith in system.”

---

#Revolt of the Exiles

While Karl struggled to keep his shrinking tribe from collapsing, news reached them of Big Thag’s capitalist splinter group. 

Thag’s tribe was thriving. Rumors spread of huge mammoth feasts, shiny tools, and something called “private housing.” 

Worse, Big Thag was allegedly trading surplus mammoth meat to a third group led by Small Zog, who had apparently turned Riverbank Gulag into a bustling free market economy.

“Thag and Zog traitors!” Karl shouted when he heard the news. “They exploit tribe with greed and selfishness! We must crush counter-revolution!”

Karl gathered the remaining members of his tribe—Lazy Ugg, Old Grug, and a confused child who had wandered into the cave looking for berries. 

Armed with sticks and righteous fury, they marched toward Thag’s camp, determined to reclaim the mammoth meat in the name of the Pebbletariat.

---

#The Final Showdown

When Karl’s ragged crew arrived at Thag’s camp, they were stunned. Thag’s tribe lived in clean, organized huts. Mammoth ribs roasted over open fires. Children played with toys carved from bones. Thag himself lounged on a throne made of polished rocks.

“Cave Karl!” Thag bellowed when he saw them. “What bring you here? Need food? Or just here to complain?”

Karl ignored him. “This prosperity built on lies! Mammoth meat stolen from collective! We demand redistribution!”

Thag laughed. “Why should me share with you? You no hunt. You no help. You only shout and wave stick!”

Karl turned to his companions for backup. “See? Proof of oppression! We fight for justice! For equality! For—wait, where everyone go?”

He spun around to find Lazy Ugg happily munching on a mammoth leg and Old Grug negotiating a trade for one of Thag’s shiny rocks. Even the confused child had abandoned him in favor of the roasted squirrel skewers.

Karl fell to his knees, shaking his stick at the sky. “Ungrateful fools! You doom tribe! Without communism, you descend into chaos! Into… oh, is that mammoth stew?”

---

#Epilogue

Cave Karl eventually joined Thag’s tribe, though he insisted on calling himself a “consultant.” His ideas were occasionally useful—like inventing the wheel—but most of the time, he just sat in the corner, muttering about “inevitable revolution.”

As for communism? It was officially declared extinct after the disastrous “Two Pebble Policy.” But every so often, someone would hear Karl grumbling about “proletariat uprising” and laugh. After all, there was plenty of mammoth for everyone.

Libertarian,1h0sh2z,Cave Karl and the Communist Manifesto,"In the heart of a smoky, dimly lit cave, the tribe gathered around their most learned caveman, Cave Karl. Armed with a stick for a pen and a particularly flat rock for a desk, he grunted and gestured with great enthusiasm. 

Onlookers were skeptical but curious; after all, Cave Karl had recently invented “thinking,” and it had already caused quite a stir.

“Ug! Why some have big mammoth, others only puny rabbit?” Cave Karl bellowed, thumping his stick against the cave wall. “It unfair! Mammoth belong to all!”

The crowd murmured in agreement. Big Thag, the richest caveman in the tribe (and owner of at least three mammoth carcasses), frowned and crossed his arms.

“But me hunt mammoth! Me use big rock! Me earn mammoth!” Big Thag retorted.

Cave Karl pointed his stick accusingly. “But you no hunt alone! Small Zog help throw spear. Old Grug scare mammoth with fire. And me, Cave Karl, provide moral support by saying ‘Good job!’ Mammoth no just yours. Mammoth belong to collective!”

Small Zog, always feeling underappreciated, clapped his hands. “Yeah! Zog only get mammoth feet! Tastes like dirt!”

Big Thag rolled his eyes. “If Zog no like feet, Zog hunt own mammoth!”

This incensed Cave Karl. “Aha! You prove point! System broken! It mammoth-eat-mammoth world out there. No fairness. No sharing. No solidarity! We need new system: Communalism—wait, no—COMMUNISM!”

The crowd gasped. Someone in the back muttered, “What communism?”

Cave Karl puffed out his chest. “Communism simple. No one own anything. All belong to tribe. Mammoth? Tribe. Fire? Tribe. Sharpest rock? Tribe. Even Thag’s fancy bone necklace? Tribe!”

Thag clutched his necklace in horror. “But this MY necklace! My grandma chew bone for hours to make smooth!”

“Grandma chew for tribe!” Cave Karl countered. “Necklace not yours! Necklace symbolic of capitalist greed!”

Another caveman piped up. “But if no one own anything, why me bother hunt mammoth at all? Why not just sit and eat berries?”

Cave Karl wagged his stick. “Under communism, tribe share EVERYTHING, including mammoth and berries. If you no hunt, you help another way—like, uh, drawing pretty pictures on cave walls or sharpening spears!”

“But what if I just nap all day?” asked Lazy Ugg, scratching his armpit.

Cave Karl hesitated for a moment but quickly recovered. “Then… you napping for tribe! Tribe benefit from well-rested member!”

This was met with much applause. Lazy Ugg smiled, his revolutionary spirit suddenly awakened.

---

#Implementation of Communism

The next day, Cave Karl led a redistribution effort. He declared that Big Thag’s three mammoth carcasses must be divided equally among all 20 members of the tribe. 

The problem arose when everyone showed up to collect their share. By the time the 20th person arrived, there was nothing left but a single mammoth tooth.

“Where mammoth?” cried Small Zog.

“Ah,” Cave Karl explained, “distribution difficult. Mammoth heavy. Mammoth also rot. But not problem! We make new rule: Everyone eat equal share of imaginary mammoth!”

“Imaginary mammoth?!” Big Thag bellowed. “Me starving! Tribe starving! Where real food?”

“No need for mammoth under communism!” Cave Karl declared triumphantly. “We grow berry farm! But all must help, or else no berries.”

Naturally, Lazy Ugg claimed he was already contributing by napping. Small Zog sharpened sticks but promptly poked himself in the foot and had to sit out. Old Grug wandered off, muttering something about “back in my day.” 

By evening, the berry farm had yielded exactly one berry.

Cave Karl bit into it dramatically. “Mmm… taste of equality.”

Libertarian,1h0ftm6,Snope v. Brown Distributed for Conference December 13th!,"This is the Maryland AWB case.

https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-203.html

Here we go lads!

What this means:

* SCOTUS will conference on this case December 13th. 
* The earliest we will hear on if they take the case is December 16th
 * Given some justices have already expressly said they want to hear it we could see that, but I doubt it would be granted so quickly.
* There is *NO* set timeline for them to decide on cert
* Most cases get relisted at least once, to give SCOTUS more time to discuss and decide on cert
* Generally speaking, the more times after twice it gets relisted, the lower the chance of granting. But that is a general trend not a hard rule.


I believe they are very likely to take the case for a number of reasons:

1. It's on final en-banc judgement. The only avenue left for relief is SCOTUS.
2. The case has been GVR'd and come back with the same result.
3. Several justices expressed desire to hear the case, even on on *preliminary* basis.
4. This is the #1 2nd amendment issue in the nation at this time.
5. There's numerous other cases in numerous other circuits.
6. The Republicans won, so SCOTUS does not have to fear retaliation for 2-4 years for ruling pro-2A.
7. The 4th circuit pulled a sneaky and took the case *En Banc* before final panel judgement, despite neither the plaintiff nor defendant motioning for such. 
 * It is implied the panel was going to strike the law, and the 4th circuit yoinked it up to uphold it. But that's merely speculation.
8. SCOTUS is 6-3 conservative
 * Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Alito have all signaled or actively ruled in lower courts their opposition to an AWB
 * Roberts and Barrett are the two unknowns, but Barret signed onto the majority in *Bruen* not the watered down concurrence. And Roberts did rule with the majority.

But this is no guarantee. If they deny cert it likely means that both Roberts and Barrett cannot be counted on.

Libertarian,1h0ftm6,Snope v. Brown Distributed for Conference December 13th!,"This is the Maryland AWB case.

https://www.supremecourt.gov/docket/docketfiles/html/public/24-203.html

Here we go lads!

What this means:

* SCOTUS will conference on this case December 13th. 
* The earliest we will hear on if they take the case is December 16th
 * Given some justices have already expressly said they want to hear it we could see that, but I doubt it would be granted so quickly.
* There is *NO* set timeline for them to decide on cert
* Most cases get relisted at least once, to give SCOTUS more time to discuss and decide on cert
* Generally speaking, the more times after twice it gets relisted, the lower the chance of granting. But that is a general trend not a hard rule.


I believe they are very likely to take the case for a number of reasons:

1. It's on final en-banc judgement. The only avenue left for relief is SCOTUS.
2. The case has been GVR'd and come back with the same result.
3. Several justices expressed desire to hear the case, even on on *preliminary* basis.
4. This is the #1 2nd amendment issue in the nation at this time.
5. There's numerous other cases in numerous other circuits.
6. The Republicans won, so SCOTUS does not have to fear retaliation for 2-4 years for ruling pro-2A.
7. The 4th circuit pulled a sneaky and took the case *En Banc* before final panel judgement, despite neither the plaintiff nor defendant motioning for such. 
 * It is implied the panel was going to strike the law, and the 4th circuit yoinked it up to uphold it. But that's merely speculation.
8. SCOTUS is 6-3 conservative
 * Thomas, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Alito have all signaled or actively ruled in lower courts their opposition to an AWB
 * Roberts and Barrett are the two unknowns, but Barret signed onto the majority in *Bruen* not the watered down concurrence. And Roberts did rule with the majority.

But this is no guarantee. If they deny cert it likely means that both Roberts and Barrett cannot be counted on.

**Title: The Overlap Between Greek Mythology and Libertarian Socioeconomic Power Structures**

### Introduction
The parallels between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics provide a compelling framework for understanding the concentration of power and its pervasive influence on societal structures. Both systems elevate titanic figures—whether deities or economic elites—to the apex of hierarchical frameworks, ultimately shaping the lives and opportunities of those situated beneath them. By analyzing these overlaps, we gain deeper insights into the manner in which libertarian ideals might inadvertently replicate the power dynamics embedded in ancient mythological paradigms.

### The Role of Socioeconomic Titans
In Greek mythology, those at the top occupy the highest echelon of power, exercising absolute dominion over both the natural world and human society. These entities are capricious, demanding, and largely beyond the influence of mortals. This divine hierarchy finds a compelling parallel in the libertarian socioeconomic order, where powerful corporations and wealthy elites operate with significant autonomy, often insulated from external checks or balances.

The figures at the top, through their direct control over the fate of mortals, reflect contemporary economic titans—multinational corporations such as Amazon, Tesla, and BlackRock—that exert disproportionate influence over markets, labor conditions, and socio-political opportunities. Much like those whose power was both revered and feared, these corporate giants often determine the scope of individual possibilities within the social and economic order. In both frameworks, power is highly concentrated, compelling those at the bottom to navigate an environment dominated by forces well beyond their control.

### Influence and Hierarchical Power Without Traditional State Mechanisms
One of the inherent tensions within the libertarian ambition to minimize state intervention lies in the unintended emergence of structures resembling **neo-feudalism**, wherein economic power assumes a dominant societal role traditionally held by political authority. In Greek mythology, those at the top frequently utilized city-states, kings, and heroes as intermediaries to fulfill their desires, rendering these mortal agents instruments of divine will. This dynamic closely mirrors the mechanisms by which wealthy elites and corporations, in a libertarian context, leverage economic influence to shape policies, direct labor markets, and solidify their dominance.

The absence of a centralized state apparatus allows these economic elites to assume roles akin to those of mythological deities—dictating the conditions under which individuals operate, with minimal opportunities for resistance. This phenomenon bears resemblance to historical feudal arrangements, where substantial control over economic and social systems rested in the hands of a few, resulting in limited agency for the broader population. While libertarian philosophy often emphasizes the value of a decentralized state, the resulting vacuum may facilitate the rise of non-state powers that govern in a manner reminiscent of traditional feudal lords.

### The Misunderstanding of Power Dynamics
A significant challenge within libertarian discourse is a misunderstanding of how power manifests beyond the scope of the state. Many libertarian proponents, especially those at an early stage of engagement, focus primarily on dismantling state power while neglecting the broader implications of unregulated economic authority. Greek mythology serves as an instructive narrative, demonstrating how power can be cultural, social, or divine—extending far beyond formal governance structures and highlighting the complexities inherent in any hierarchical order.

This oversight can often be traced back to reductive interpretations of critical theory, such as those found in the Frankfurt School, which tend to emphasize the dismantling of state mechanisms without accounting for the analogous power structures that may emerge within an economic framework. Just as mythology depicts powerful figures exercising influence over mortals, libertarian socioeconomics, in the absence of regulatory safeguards, risks fostering a similar concentration of power that can become as arbitrary and hierarchical as the divine authority depicted in mythological narratives.

Moreover, just as those at the top functioned beyond the reach of mortal justice, large corporations today often operate in a sphere largely shielded from traditional forms of accountability. Corporate lobbying, wealth accumulation, and control over critical infrastructure enable a select group of economic actors to exercise control over societal outcomes in a manner reminiscent of mythological sway over human destinies.

### Mythology as Modern Power Narratives
Mythology functioned as a cultural narrative that sought to rationalize existing social hierarchies and legitimize the concentration of power among a select few. The omnipotent role of those at the top provided an explanation for both natural and social phenomena, thereby justifying established hierarchies. In a libertarian context, the myth of the self-made individual and the glorification of unrestrained market dynamics serve a similar purpose—providing ideological legitimacy to the dominance of economic elites.

The narrative of individualism often overshadows the ways in which structural power operates. The glorification of self-reliance, much like the myths of heroes who attempted to challenge or gain favor from the powerful, creates an illusion that power is within reach of every individual, regardless of systemic inequities. However, the reality often reveals a deeply entrenched hierarchy, where those with pre-existing power—be it mythological or economic in the modern context—dictate the terms of success and survival.

If mythology were transposed to a contemporary setting, those at the top could easily be envisioned as corporate titans—figures whose expansive influence molds the economic and social landscape with a reach that is often beyond reproach. These modern analogues wield power in a fashion reminiscent of mythological figures manipulating mortal affairs, underscoring the limitations of libertarian frameworks that prioritize individual freedom while failing to address the unchecked accumulation of economic power. The resulting power dynamics create a framework in which the ideals of freedom and autonomy become unattainable for many, existing only as myths that obscure the enduring reality of stratification and subordination.

### Conclusion
The intersections between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics reveal significant insights into the nature of power and its impact on societal structures. Both paradigms are defined by the centralization of authority—whether mythological or economic—that individuals must navigate in their quest for autonomy. By juxtaposing the hierarchical structures inherent in mythology with the potential ramifications of libertarian socioeconomics, we can observe how unchecked power may lead to a contemporary reimagining of subjugation under capricious, yet influential ""titans.""

**Title: The Overlap Between Greek Mythology and Libertarian Socioeconomic Power Structures**

### Introduction
The parallels between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics provide a compelling framework for understanding the concentration of power and its pervasive influence on societal structures. Both systems elevate titanic figures—whether deities or economic elites—to the apex of hierarchical frameworks, ultimately shaping the lives and opportunities of those situated beneath them. By analyzing these overlaps, we gain deeper insights into the manner in which libertarian ideals might inadvertently replicate the power dynamics embedded in ancient mythological paradigms.

### The Role of Socioeconomic Titans
In Greek mythology, those at the top occupy the highest echelon of power, exercising absolute dominion over both the natural world and human society. These entities are capricious, demanding, and largely beyond the influence of mortals. This divine hierarchy finds a compelling parallel in the libertarian socioeconomic order, where powerful corporations and wealthy elites operate with significant autonomy, often insulated from external checks or balances.

The figures at the top, through their direct control over the fate of mortals, reflect contemporary economic titans—multinational corporations such as Amazon, Tesla, and BlackRock—that exert disproportionate influence over markets, labor conditions, and socio-political opportunities. Much like those whose power was both revered and feared, these corporate giants often determine the scope of individual possibilities within the social and economic order. In both frameworks, power is highly concentrated, compelling those at the bottom to navigate an environment dominated by forces well beyond their control.

### Influence and Hierarchical Power Without Traditional State Mechanisms
One of the inherent tensions within the libertarian ambition to minimize state intervention lies in the unintended emergence of structures resembling **neo-feudalism**, wherein economic power assumes a dominant societal role traditionally held by political authority. In Greek mythology, those at the top frequently utilized city-states, kings, and heroes as intermediaries to fulfill their desires, rendering these mortal agents instruments of divine will. This dynamic closely mirrors the mechanisms by which wealthy elites and corporations, in a libertarian context, leverage economic influence to shape policies, direct labor markets, and solidify their dominance.

The absence of a centralized state apparatus allows these economic elites to assume roles akin to those of mythological deities—dictating the conditions under which individuals operate, with minimal opportunities for resistance. This phenomenon bears resemblance to historical feudal arrangements, where substantial control over economic and social systems rested in the hands of a few, resulting in limited agency for the broader population. While libertarian philosophy often emphasizes the value of a decentralized state, the resulting vacuum may facilitate the rise of non-state powers that govern in a manner reminiscent of traditional feudal lords.

### The Misunderstanding of Power Dynamics
A significant challenge within libertarian discourse is a misunderstanding of how power manifests beyond the scope of the state. Many libertarian proponents, especially those at an early stage of engagement, focus primarily on dismantling state power while neglecting the broader implications of unregulated economic authority. Greek mythology serves as an instructive narrative, demonstrating how power can be cultural, social, or divine—extending far beyond formal governance structures and highlighting the complexities inherent in any hierarchical order.

This oversight can often be traced back to reductive interpretations of critical theory, such as those found in the Frankfurt School, which tend to emphasize the dismantling of state mechanisms without accounting for the analogous power structures that may emerge within an economic framework. Just as mythology depicts powerful figures exercising influence over mortals, libertarian socioeconomics, in the absence of regulatory safeguards, risks fostering a similar concentration of power that can become as arbitrary and hierarchical as the divine authority depicted in mythological narratives.

Moreover, just as those at the top functioned beyond the reach of mortal justice, large corporations today often operate in a sphere largely shielded from traditional forms of accountability. Corporate lobbying, wealth accumulation, and control over critical infrastructure enable a select group of economic actors to exercise control over societal outcomes in a manner reminiscent of mythological sway over human destinies.

### Mythology as Modern Power Narratives
Mythology functioned as a cultural narrative that sought to rationalize existing social hierarchies and legitimize the concentration of power among a select few. The omnipotent role of those at the top provided an explanation for both natural and social phenomena, thereby justifying established hierarchies. In a libertarian context, the myth of the self-made individual and the glorification of unrestrained market dynamics serve a similar purpose—providing ideological legitimacy to the dominance of economic elites.

The narrative of individualism often overshadows the ways in which structural power operates. The glorification of self-reliance, much like the myths of heroes who attempted to challenge or gain favor from the powerful, creates an illusion that power is within reach of every individual, regardless of systemic inequities. However, the reality often reveals a deeply entrenched hierarchy, where those with pre-existing power—be it mythological or economic in the modern context—dictate the terms of success and survival.

If mythology were transposed to a contemporary setting, those at the top could easily be envisioned as corporate titans—figures whose expansive influence molds the economic and social landscape with a reach that is often beyond reproach. These modern analogues wield power in a fashion reminiscent of mythological figures manipulating mortal affairs, underscoring the limitations of libertarian frameworks that prioritize individual freedom while failing to address the unchecked accumulation of economic power. The resulting power dynamics create a framework in which the ideals of freedom and autonomy become unattainable for many, existing only as myths that obscure the enduring reality of stratification and subordination.

### Conclusion
The intersections between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics reveal significant insights into the nature of power and its impact on societal structures. Both paradigms are defined by the centralization of authority—whether mythological or economic—that individuals must navigate in their quest for autonomy. By juxtaposing the hierarchical structures inherent in mythology with the potential ramifications of libertarian socioeconomics, we can observe how unchecked power may lead to a contemporary reimagining of subjugation under capricious, yet influential ""titans."" This understanding is crucial for critically evaluating libertarian promises of freedom, ensuring that the pursuit of individual autonomy does not inadvertently give rise to new forms of systemic dominance and stratification that closely resemble historical feudal hierarchies.

The recognition of these parallels compels us to question whether a libertarian order, in seeking to liberate individuals from state authority, may inadvertently empower economic actors to assume similarly domineering roles.

This dynamic closely mirrors the mechanisms by which wealthy elites and corporations, in a libertarian context, leverage economic influence to shape policies, direct labor markets, and solidify their dominance.

The absence of a centralized state apparatus allows these economic elites to assume roles akin to those of mythological deities—dictating the conditions under which individuals operate, with minimal opportunities for resistance. This phenomenon bears resemblance to historical feudal arrangements, where substantial control over economic and social systems rested in the hands of a few, resulting in limited agency for the broader population. While libertarian philosophy often emphasizes the value of a decentralized state, the resulting vacuum may facilitate the rise of non-state powers that govern in a manner reminiscent of traditional feudal lords.

### The Misunderstanding of Power Dynamics
A significant challenge within libertarian discourse is a misunderstanding of how power manifests beyond the scope of the state. Many libertarian proponents, especially those at an early stage of engagement, focus primarily on dismantling state power while neglecting the broader implications of unregulated economic authority. Greek mythology serves as an instructive narrative, demonstrating how power can be cultural, social, or divine—extending far beyond formal governance structures and highlighting the complexities inherent in any hierarchical order.

This oversight can often be traced back to reductive interpretations of critical theory, such as those found in the Frankfurt School, which tend to emphasize the dismantling of state mechanisms without accounting for the analogous power structures that may emerge within an economic framework. Just as mythology depicts powerful figures exercising influence over mortals, libertarian socioeconomics, in the absence of regulatory safeguards, risks fostering a similar concentration of power that can become as arbitrary and hierarchical as the divine authority depicted in mythological narratives.

Moreover, just as those at the top functioned beyond the reach of mortal justice, large corporations today often operate in a sphere largely shielded from traditional forms of accountability. Corporate lobbying, wealth accumulation, and control over critical infrastructure enable a select group of economic actors to exercise control over societal outcomes in a manner reminiscent of mythological sway over human destinies.

### Mythology as Modern Power Narratives
Mythology functioned as a cultural narrative that sought to rationalize existing social hierarchies and legitimize the concentration of power among a select few. The omnipotent role of those at the top provided an explanation for both natural and social phenomena, thereby justifying established hierarchies. In a libertarian context, the myth of the self-made individual and the glorification of unrestrained market dynamics serve a similar purpose—providing ideological legitimacy to the dominance of economic elites.

The narrative of individualism often overshadows the ways in which structural power operates. The glorification of self-reliance, much like the myths of heroes who attempted to challenge or gain favor from the powerful, creates an illusion that power is within reach of every individual, regardless of systemic inequities. However, the reality often reveals a deeply entrenched hierarchy, where those with pre-existing power—be it mythological or economic in the modern context—dictate the terms of success and survival.

If mythology were transposed to a contemporary setting, those at the top could easily be envisioned as corporate titans—figures whose expansive influence molds the economic and social landscape with a reach that is often beyond reproach. These modern analogues wield power in a fashion reminiscent of mythological figures manipulating mortal affairs, underscoring the limitations of libertarian frameworks that prioritize individual freedom while failing to address the unchecked accumulation of economic power. The resulting power dynamics create a framework in which the ideals of freedom and autonomy become unattainable for many, existing only as myths that obscure the enduring reality of stratification and subordination.

### Conclusion
The intersections between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics reveal significant insights into the nature of power and its impact on societal structures. Both paradigms are defined by the centralization of authority—whether mythological or economic—that individuals must navigate in their quest for autonomy. By juxtaposing the hierarchical structures inherent in mythology with the potential ramifications of libertarian socioeconomics, we can observe how unchecked power may lead to a contemporary reimagining of subjugation under capricious, yet influential ""titans."" This understanding is crucial for critically evaluating libertarian promises of freedom, ensuring that the pursuit of individual autonomy does not inadvertently give rise to new forms of systemic dominance and stratification that closely resemble historical feudal hierarchies.

The recognition of these parallels compels us to question whether a libertarian order, in seeking to liberate individuals from state authority, may inadvertently empower economic actors to assume similarly domineering roles. As with the powerful figures of mythology, unchecked power in the hands of a few can lead to a social landscape characterized by subordination, limited agency, and the reemergence of structures that closely resemble those of historical feudalism—where freedom is often an illusion available only to those who already hold power.

**Title: The Overlap Between Greek Mythology and Libertarian Socioeconomic Power Structures**

### Introduction
The parallels between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics provide a compelling framework for understanding the concentration of power and its pervasive influence on societal structures. Both systems elevate titanic figures—whether deities or economic elites—to the apex of hierarchical frameworks, ultimately shaping the lives and opportunities of those situated beneath them. By analyzing these overlaps, we gain deeper insights into the manner in which libertarian ideals might inadvertently replicate the power dynamics embedded in ancient mythological paradigms.

### The Role of Socioeconomic Titans
In Greek mythology, those at the top occupy the highest echelon of power, exercising absolute dominion over both the natural world and human society. These entities are capricious, demanding, and largely beyond the influence of mortals. This divine hierarchy finds a compelling parallel in the libertarian socioeconomic order, where powerful corporations and wealthy elites operate with significant autonomy, often insulated from external checks or balances.

The figures at the top, through their direct control over the fate of mortals, reflect contemporary economic titans—multinational corporations such as Amazon, Tesla, and BlackRock—that exert disproportionate influence over markets, labor conditions, and socio-political opportunities. Much like those whose power was both revered and feared, these corporate giants often determine the scope of individual possibilities within the social and economic order. In both frameworks, power is highly concentrated, compelling those at the bottom to navigate an environment dominated by forces well beyond their control.

### Influence and Hierarchical Power Without Traditional State Mechanisms
One of the inherent tensions within the libertarian ambition to minimize state intervention lies in the unintended emergence of structures resembling **neo-feudalism**, wherein economic power assumes a dominant societal role traditionally held by political authority.

However, the reality often reveals a deeply entrenched hierarchy, where those with pre-existing power—be it mythological or economic in the modern context—dictate the terms of success and survival.

If mythology were transposed to a contemporary setting, those at the top could easily be envisioned as corporate titans—figures whose expansive influence molds the economic and social landscape with a reach that is often beyond reproach. These modern analogues wield power in a fashion reminiscent of mythological figures manipulating mortal affairs, underscoring the limitations of libertarian frameworks that prioritize individual freedom while failing to address the unchecked accumulation of economic power. The resulting power dynamics create a framework in which the ideals of freedom and autonomy become unattainable for many, existing only as myths that obscure the enduring reality of stratification and subordination.

### Conclusion
The intersections between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics reveal significant insights into the nature of power and its impact on societal structures. Both paradigms are defined by the centralization of authority—whether mythological or economic—that individuals must navigate in their quest for autonomy. By juxtaposing the hierarchical structures inherent in mythology with the potential ramifications of libertarian socioeconomics, we can observe how unchecked power may lead to a contemporary reimagining of subjugation under capricious, yet influential ""titans."" This understanding is crucial for critically evaluating libertarian promises of freedom, ensuring that the pursuit of individual autonomy does not inadvertently give rise to new forms of systemic dominance and stratification that closely resemble historical feudal hierarchies.

The recognition of these parallels compels us to question whether a libertarian order, in seeking to liberate individuals from state authority, may inadvertently empower economic actors to assume similarly domineering roles. As with the powerful figures of mythology, unchecked power in the hands of a few can lead to a social landscape characterized by subordination, limited agency, and the reemergence of structures that closely resemble those of historical feudalism—where freedom is often an illusion available only to those who already hold power.

**Title: The Overlap Between Greek Mythology and Libertarian Socioeconomic Power Structures**

### Introduction
The parallels between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics provide a compelling framework for understanding the concentration of power and its pervasive influence on societal structures. Both systems elevate titanic figures—whether deities or economic elites—to the apex of hierarchical frameworks, ultimately shaping the lives and opportunities of those situated beneath them. By analyzing these overlaps, we gain deeper insights into the manner in which libertarian ideals might inadvertently replicate the power dynamics embedded in ancient mythological paradigms.

### The Role of Socioeconomic Titans
In Greek mythology, those at the top occupy the highest echelon of power, exercising absolute dominion over both the natural world and human society. These entities are capricious, demanding, and largely beyond the influence of mortals. This divine hierarchy finds a compelling parallel in the libertarian socioeconomic order, where powerful corporations and wealthy elites operate with significant autonomy, often insulated from external checks or balances.

The figures at the top, through their direct control over the fate of mortals, reflect contemporary economic titans—multinational corporations such as Amazon, Tesla, and BlackRock—that exert disproportionate influence over markets, labor conditions, and socio-political opportunities. Much like those whose power was both revered and feared, these corporate giants often determine the scope of individual possibilities within the social and economic order. In both frameworks, power is highly concentrated, compelling those at the bottom to navigate an environment dominated by forces well beyond their control.

### Influence and Hierarchical Power Without Traditional State Mechanisms
One of the inherent tensions within the libertarian ambition to minimize state intervention lies in the unintended emergence of structures resembling **neo-feudalism**, wherein economic power assumes a dominant societal role traditionally held by political authority. In Greek mythology, those at the top frequently utilized city-states, kings, and heroes as intermediaries to fulfill their desires, rendering these mortal agents instruments of divine will. This dynamic closely mirrors the mechanisms by which wealthy elites and corporations, in a libertarian context, leverage economic influence to shape policies, direct labor markets, and solidify their dominance.

The absence of a centralized state apparatus allows these economic elites to assume roles akin to those of mythological deities—dictating the conditions under which individuals operate, with minimal opportunities for resistance. This phenomenon bears resemblance to historical feudal arrangements, where substantial control over economic and social systems rested in the hands of a few, resulting in limited agency for the broader population. While libertarian philosophy often emphasizes the value of a decentralized state, the resulting vacuum may facilitate the rise of non-state powers that govern in a manner reminiscent of traditional feudal lords.

### The Misunderstanding of Power Dynamics
A significant challenge within libertarian discourse is a misunderstanding of how power manifests beyond the scope of the state. Many libertarian proponents, especially those at an early stage of engagement, focus primarily on dismantling state power while neglecting the broader implications of unregulated economic authority. Greek mythology serves as an instructive narrative, demonstrating how power can be cultural, social, or divine—extending far beyond formal governance structures and highlighting the complexities inherent in any hierarchical order.

This oversight can often be traced back to reductive interpretations of critical theory, such as those found in the Frankfurt School, which tend to emphasize the dismantling of state mechanisms without accounting for the analogous power structures that may emerge within an economic framework. Just as mythology depicts powerful figures exercising influence over mortals, libertarian socioeconomics, in the absence of regulatory safeguards, risks fostering a similar concentration of power that can become as arbitrary and hierarchical as the divine authority depicted in mythological narratives.

Moreover, just as those at the top functioned beyond the reach of mortal justice, large corporations today often operate in a sphere largely shielded from traditional forms of accountability. Corporate lobbying, wealth accumulation, and control over critical infrastructure enable a select group of economic actors to exercise control over societal outcomes in a manner reminiscent of mythological sway over human destinies.

### Mythology as Modern Power Narratives
Mythology functioned as a cultural narrative that sought to rationalize existing social hierarchies and legitimize the concentration of power among a select few. The omnipotent role of those at the top provided an explanation for both natural and social phenomena, thereby justifying established hierarchies. In a libertarian context, the myth of the self-made individual and the glorification of unrestrained market dynamics serve a similar purpose—providing ideological legitimacy to the dominance of economic elites.

The narrative of individualism often overshadows the ways in which structural power operates. The glorification of self-reliance, much like the myths of heroes who attempted to challenge or gain favor from the powerful, creates an illusion that power is within reach of every individual, regardless of systemic inequities.

### The Role of Socioeconomic Titans
In Greek mythology, those at the top occupy the highest echelon of power, exercising absolute dominion over both the natural world and human society. These entities are capricious, demanding, and largely beyond the influence of mortals. This divine hierarchy finds a compelling parallel in the libertarian socioeconomic order, where powerful corporations and wealthy elites operate with significant autonomy, often insulated from external checks or balances.

The figures at the top, through their direct control over the fate of mortals, reflect contemporary economic titans—multinational corporations such as Amazon, Tesla, and BlackRock—that exert disproportionate influence over markets, labor conditions, and socio-political opportunities. Much like those whose power was both revered and feared, these corporate giants often determine the scope of individual possibilities within the social and economic order. In both frameworks, power is highly concentrated, compelling those at the bottom to navigate an environment dominated by forces well beyond their control.

### Influence and Hierarchical Power Without Traditional State Mechanisms
One of the inherent tensions within the libertarian ambition to minimize state intervention lies in the unintended emergence of structures resembling **neo-feudalism**, wherein economic power assumes a dominant societal role traditionally held by political authority. In Greek mythology, those at the top frequently utilized city-states, kings, and heroes as intermediaries to fulfill their desires, rendering these mortal agents instruments of divine will. This dynamic closely mirrors the mechanisms by which wealthy elites and corporations, in a libertarian context, leverage economic influence to shape policies, direct labor markets, and solidify their dominance.

The absence of a centralized state apparatus allows these economic elites to assume roles akin to those of mythological deities—dictating the conditions under which individuals operate, with minimal opportunities for resistance. This phenomenon bears resemblance to historical feudal arrangements, where substantial control over economic and social systems rested in the hands of a few, resulting in limited agency for the broader population. While libertarian philosophy often emphasizes the value of a decentralized state, the resulting vacuum may facilitate the rise of non-state powers that govern in a manner reminiscent of traditional feudal lords.

### The Misunderstanding of Power Dynamics
A significant challenge within libertarian discourse is a misunderstanding of how power manifests beyond the scope of the state. Many libertarian proponents, especially those at an early stage of engagement, focus primarily on dismantling state power while neglecting the broader implications of unregulated economic authority. Greek mythology serves as an instructive narrative, demonstrating how power can be cultural, social, or divine—extending far beyond formal governance structures and highlighting the complexities inherent in any hierarchical order.

This oversight can often be traced back to reductive interpretations of critical theory, such as those found in the Frankfurt School, which tend to emphasize the dismantling of state mechanisms without accounting for the analogous power structures that may emerge within an economic framework. Just as mythology depicts powerful figures exercising influence over mortals, libertarian socioeconomics, in the absence of regulatory safeguards, risks fostering a similar concentration of power that can become as arbitrary and hierarchical as the divine authority depicted in mythological narratives.

Moreover, just as those at the top functioned beyond the reach of mortal justice, large corporations today often operate in a sphere largely shielded from traditional forms of accountability. Corporate lobbying, wealth accumulation, and control over critical infrastructure enable a select group of economic actors to exercise control over societal outcomes in a manner reminiscent of mythological sway over human destinies.

### Mythology as Modern Power Narratives
Mythology functioned as a cultural narrative that sought to rationalize existing social hierarchies and legitimize the concentration of power among a select few. The omnipotent role of those at the top provided an explanation for both natural and social phenomena, thereby justifying established hierarchies. In a libertarian context, the myth of the self-made individual and the glorification of unrestrained market dynamics serve a similar purpose—providing ideological legitimacy to the dominance of economic elites.

The narrative of individualism often overshadows the ways in which structural power operates. The glorification of self-reliance, much like the myths of heroes who attempted to challenge or gain favor from the powerful, creates an illusion that power is within reach of every individual, regardless of systemic inequities. However, the reality often reveals a deeply entrenched hierarchy, where those with pre-existing power—be it mythological or economic in the modern context—dictate the terms of success and survival.

If mythology were transposed to a contemporary setting, those at the top could easily be envisioned as corporate titans—figures whose expansive influence molds the economic and social landscape with a reach that is often beyond reproach. These modern analogues wield power in a fashion reminiscent of mythological figures manipulating mortal affairs, underscoring the limitations of libertarian frameworks that prioritize individual freedom while failing to address the unchecked accumulation of economic power. The resulting power dynamics create a framework in which the ideals of freedom and autonomy become unattainable for many, existing only as myths that obscure the enduring reality of stratification and subordination.

### Conclusion
The intersections between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics reveal significant insights into the nature of power and its impact on societal structures. Both paradigms are defined by the centralization of authority—whether mythological or economic—that individuals must navigate in their quest for autonomy. By juxtaposing the hierarchical structures inherent in mythology with the potential ramifications of libertarian socioeconomics, we can observe how unchecked power may lead to a contemporary reimagining of subjugation under capricious, yet influential ""titans."" This understanding is crucial for critically evaluating libertarian promises of freedom, ensuring that the pursuit of individual autonomy does not inadvertently give rise to new forms of systemic dominance and stratification that closely resemble historical feudal hierarchies.

The recognition of these parallels compels us to question whether a libertarian order, in seeking to liberate individuals from state authority, may inadvertently empower economic actors to assume similarly domineering roles. As with the powerful figures of mythology, unchecked power in the hands of a few can lead to a social landscape characterized by subordination, limited agency, and the reemergence of structures that closely resemble those of historical feudalism—where freedom is often an illusion available only to those who already hold power.

Just as mythology depicts powerful figures exercising influence over mortals, libertarian socioeconomics, in the absence of regulatory safeguards, risks fostering a similar concentration of power that can become as arbitrary and hierarchical as the divine authority depicted in mythological narratives.

Moreover, just as those at the top functioned beyond the reach of mortal justice, large corporations today often operate in a sphere largely shielded from traditional forms of accountability. Corporate lobbying, wealth accumulation, and control over critical infrastructure enable a select group of economic actors to exercise control over societal outcomes in a manner reminiscent of mythological sway over human destinies.

### Mythology as Modern Power Narratives
Mythology functioned as a cultural narrative that sought to rationalize existing social hierarchies and legitimize the concentration of power among a select few. The omnipotent role of those at the top provided an explanation for both natural and social phenomena, thereby justifying established hierarchies. In a libertarian context, the myth of the self-made individual and the glorification of unrestrained market dynamics serve a similar purpose—providing ideological legitimacy to the dominance of economic elites.

The narrative of individualism often overshadows the ways in which structural power operates. The glorification of self-reliance, much like the myths of heroes who attempted to challenge or gain favor from the powerful, creates an illusion that power is within reach of every individual, regardless of systemic inequities. However, the reality often reveals a deeply entrenched hierarchy, where those with pre-existing power—be it mythological or economic in the modern context—dictate the terms of success and survival.

If mythology were transposed to a contemporary setting, those at the top could easily be envisioned as corporate titans—figures whose expansive influence molds the economic and social landscape with a reach that is often beyond reproach. These modern analogues wield power in a fashion reminiscent of mythological figures manipulating mortal affairs, underscoring the limitations of libertarian frameworks that prioritize individual freedom while failing to address the unchecked accumulation of economic power. The resulting power dynamics create a framework in which the ideals of freedom and autonomy become unattainable for many, existing only as myths that obscure the enduring reality of stratification and subordination.

### Conclusion
The intersections between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics reveal significant insights into the nature of power and its impact on societal structures. Both paradigms are defined by the centralization of authority—whether mythological or economic—that individuals must navigate in their quest for autonomy. By juxtaposing the hierarchical structures inherent in mythology with the potential ramifications of libertarian socioeconomics, we can observe how unchecked power may lead to a contemporary reimagining of subjugation under capricious, yet influential ""titans."" This understanding is crucial for critically evaluating libertarian promises of freedom, ensuring that the pursuit of individual autonomy does not inadvertently give rise to new forms of systemic dominance and stratification that closely resemble historical feudal hierarchies.

The recognition of these parallels compels us to question whether a libertarian order, in seeking to liberate individuals from state authority, may inadvertently empower economic actors to assume similarly domineering roles. As with the powerful figures of mythology, unchecked power in the hands of a few can lead to a social landscape characterized by subordination, limited agency, and the reemergence of structures that closely resemble those of historical feudalism—where freedom is often an illusion available only to those who already hold power.

**Title: The Overlap Between Greek Mythology and Libertarian Socioeconomic Power Structures**

### Introduction
The parallels between Greek mythology and libertarian socioeconomics provide a compelling framework for understanding the concentration of power and its pervasive influence on societal structures. Both systems elevate titanic figures—whether deities or economic elites—to the apex of hierarchical frameworks, ultimately shaping the lives and opportunities of those situated beneath them. By analyzing these overlaps, we gain deeper insights into the manner in which libertarian ideals might inadvertently replicate the power dynamics embedded in ancient mythological paradigms.

### The Role of Socioeconomic Titans
In Greek mythology, those at the top occupy the highest echelon of power, exercising absolute dominion over both the natural world and human society. These entities are capricious, demanding, and largely beyond the influence of mortals. This divine hierarchy finds a compelling parallel in the libertarian socioeconomic order, where powerful corporations and wealthy elites operate with significant autonomy, often insulated from external checks or balances.

The figures at the top, through their direct control over the fate of mortals, reflect contemporary economic titans—multinational corporations such as Amazon, Tesla, and BlackRock—that exert disproportionate influence over markets, labor conditions, and socio-political opportunities. Much like those whose power was both revered and feared, these corporate giants often determine the scope of individual possibilities within the social and economic order. In both frameworks, power is highly concentrated, compelling those at the bottom to navigate an environment dominated by forces well beyond their control.

### Influence and Hierarchical Power Without Traditional State Mechanisms
One of the inherent tensions within the libertarian ambition to minimize state intervention lies in the unintended emergence of structures resembling **neo-feudalism**, wherein economic power assumes a dominant societal role traditionally held by political authority. In Greek mythology, those at the top frequently utilized city-states, kings, and heroes as intermediaries to fulfill their desires, rendering these mortal agents instruments of divine will. This dynamic closely mirrors the mechanisms by which wealthy elites and corporations, in a libertarian context, leverage economic influence to shape policies, direct labor markets, and solidify their dominance.

The absence of a centralized state apparatus allows these economic elites to assume roles akin to those of mythological deities—dictating the conditions under which individuals operate, with minimal opportunities for resistance. This phenomenon bears resemblance to historical feudal arrangements, where substantial control over economic and social systems rested in the hands of a few, resulting in limited agency for the broader population. While libertarian philosophy often emphasizes the value of a decentralized state, the resulting vacuum may facilitate the rise of non-state powers that govern in a manner reminiscent of traditional feudal lords.

### The Misunderstanding of Power Dynamics
A significant challenge within libertarian discourse is a misunderstanding of how power manifests beyond the scope of the state. Many libertarian proponents, especially those at an early stage of engagement, focus primarily on dismantling state power while neglecting the broader implications of unregulated economic authority. Greek mythology serves as an instructive narrative, demonstrating how power can be cultural, social, or divine—extending far beyond formal governance structures and highlighting the complexities inherent in any hierarchical order.

This oversight can often be traced back to reductive interpretations of critical theory, such as those found in the Frankfurt School, which tend to emphasize the dismantling of state mechanisms without accounting for the analogous power structures that may emerge within an economic framework.

Libertarian,1gm3ssa,Anti corruption movement,"The goal of this movement is to create a government that is more transparent and less corrupt, things almost all Americans want at this moment. The idea is simple, it’s to create a political party that is meant to be temporary and really isn’t a party but a movement. This new party we create will have to have no connection to large donations, PAC money or do any advertising or collaboration with corporate owned media. Small individual donations only will be accepted by the party and all money taken in and spent will be completely transparent, accounted for and public information seen by everyone.



It’s important that the party isn’t partisan at all, the main if not the only goal is to rid the government of corruption so it may again function to serve the people of the United States. Both major political parties are complicit and seemingly unwilling to curb the corruption.



It has become a self-evident truth that a movement is necessary so that government positions are sought out by people that want to serve the people of America, rather than themselves and the interest of the wealthy first. In order to achieve this a series of ethics laws and new governmental oaths will have to be established, implemented and enforced.



A movement with such ambitions will not be popular with the politicians or the wealthy since they have an absolute stranglehold on power in the government, so the movement will have to be a populist movement  with overwhelming support of the people. That is why it’s important the movement is not concerned with partisan politics and only has one goal. The cooperation of the two major political parties will be important in passing these laws, only overwhelming support from the people will force them. The cooperation from these politicians will come from promising them no retribution for their previous actions and support, that is not the goal of the movement, looking back and placing blame will only hamper the movement, the focus must be on the future. We must only prosecute  politicians that break the new laws in the future.



It’s only necessary for the movement to run for one office and that is the office of president of the United States. The goal is also the only issue or policy necessary, it’s better that we only focus on the goal. The candidate while in office needs to be as unbiased as possible and not lean into his/her own bias but rather try their honest best to be nonpartisan on all other issues, this is important for more than one reason but mostly so we don’t lose any support of the people. The most important trait for our candidate is honesty, we have to be certain they cannot be bought, even though measures will be taken to ensure transparency.



The movement is bigger and more important than any person or candidate and the political party that is born from this movement is only a vehicle for the movement, as far as I am concerned the party can and should dissolve once the movement has completed the goals. All of the wealth and power will be opposed to the movement, so if the chosen candidate of the movement goes down, the torch of the movement must be lifted from the ground before the flame is extinguished. 





  
  
  


Laws and oaths that will be implemented will be listed and explained below in an ongoing and evolving fashion.

  


: Abolition of lobbyists in government 

: No stock or bond purchasing, selling or owning while in federal office

: Any businesses or potential conflict of interest will have to be resolved before the person will be able to serve at a federal level.

: A new and permanent ethics codes and committee to review all federal offices with power to look at all records and documents both financial and personal to ensure that all information is public and that all ethics laws and oaths are being followed

: All candidates elected to federal offices will have to take an oath more similar to the sacrifices of the oath our troops have to take.

: The new oath will include giving the right of the people of America if warranted to investigate all of your business dealing of not only yourself but the people close to you and your family will be subject to investigation even after said person has left office.  

: Reestablish and update the fairness doctrine

: Set strict new laws guiding the ethics for the Supreme Court

The candidate while in office needs to be as unbiased as possible and not lean into his/her own bias but rather try their honest best to be nonpartisan on all other issues, this is important for more than one reason but mostly so we don’t lose any support of the people. The most important trait for our candidate is honesty, we have to be certain they cannot be bought, even though measures will be taken to ensure transparency.



The movement is bigger and more important than any person or candidate and the political party that is born from this movement is only a vehicle for the movement, as far as I am concerned the party can and should dissolve once the movement has completed the goals. All of the wealth and power will be opposed to the movement, so if the chosen candidate of the movement goes down, the torch of the movement must be lifted from the ground before the flame is extinguished. 





  
  
  


Laws and oaths that will be implemented will be listed and explained below in an ongoing and evolving fashion.

  


: Abolition of lobbyists in government 

: No stock or bond purchasing, selling or owning while in federal office

: Any businesses or potential conflict of interest will have to be resolved before the person will be able to serve at a federal level.

: A new and permanent ethics codes and committee to review all federal offices with power to look at all records and documents both financial and personal to ensure that all information is public and that all ethics laws and oaths are being followed

: All candidates elected to federal offices will have to take an oath more similar to the sacrifices of the oath our troops have to take.

: The new oath will include giving the right of the people of America if warranted to investigate all of your business dealing of not only yourself but the people close to you and your family will be subject to investigation even after said person has left office.  

: Reestablish and update the fairness doctrine

: Set strict new laws guiding the ethics for the Supreme Court

Libertarian,1gm3ssa,Anti corruption movement,"The goal of this movement is to create a government that is more transparent and less corrupt, things almost all Americans want at this moment. The idea is simple, it’s to create a political party that is meant to be temporary and really isn’t a party but a movement. This new party we create will have to have no connection to large donations, PAC money or do any advertising or collaboration with corporate owned media. Small individual donations only will be accepted by the party and all money taken in and spent will be completely transparent, accounted for and public information seen by everyone.



It’s important that the party isn’t partisan at all, the main if not the only goal is to rid the government of corruption so it may again function to serve the people of the United States. Both major political parties are complicit and seemingly unwilling to curb the corruption.



It has become a self-evident truth that a movement is necessary so that government positions are sought out by people that want to serve the people of America, rather than themselves and the interest of the wealthy first. In order to achieve this a series of ethics laws and new governmental oaths will have to be established, implemented and enforced.



A movement with such ambitions will not be popular with the politicians or the wealthy since they have an absolute stranglehold on power in the government, so the movement will have to be a populist movement  with overwhelming support of the people. That is why it’s important the movement is not concerned with partisan politics and only has one goal. The cooperation of the two major political parties will be important in passing these laws, only overwhelming support from the people will force them. The cooperation from these politicians will come from promising them no retribution for their previous actions and support, that is not the goal of the movement, looking back and placing blame will only hamper the movement, the focus must be on the future. We must only prosecute  politicians that break the new laws in the future.

Libertarian,1gm3ssa,Anti corruption movement,"The goal of this movement is to create a government that is more transparent and less corrupt, things almost all Americans want at this moment. The idea is simple, it’s to create a political party that is meant to be temporary and really isn’t a party but a movement. This new party we create will have to have no connection to large donations, PAC money or do any advertising or collaboration with corporate owned media. Small individual donations only will be accepted by the party and all money taken in and spent will be completely transparent, accounted for and public information seen by everyone.



It’s important that the party isn’t partisan at all, the main if not the only goal is to rid the government of corruption so it may again function to serve the people of the United States. Both major political parties are complicit and seemingly unwilling to curb the corruption.



It has become a self-evident truth that a movement is necessary so that government positions are sought out by people that want to serve the people of America, rather than themselves and the interest of the wealthy first. In order to achieve this a series of ethics laws and new governmental oaths will have to be established, implemented and enforced.



A movement with such ambitions will not be popular with the politicians or the wealthy since they have an absolute stranglehold on power in the government, so the movement will have to be a populist movement  with overwhelming support of the people. That is why it’s important the movement is not concerned with partisan politics and only has one goal. The cooperation of the two major political parties will be important in passing these laws, only overwhelming support from the people will force them. The cooperation from these politicians will come from promising them no retribution for their previous actions and support, that is not the goal of the movement, looking back and placing blame will only hamper the movement, the focus must be on the future. We must only prosecute  politicians that break the new laws in the future.



It’s only necessary for the movement to run for one office and that is the office of president of the United States. The goal is also the only issue or policy necessary, it’s better that we only focus on the goal. The candidate while in office needs to be as unbiased as possible and not lean into his/her own bias but rather try their honest best to be nonpartisan on all other issues, this is important for more than one reason but mostly so we don’t lose any support of the people. The most important trait for our candidate is honesty, we have to be certain they cannot be bought, even though measures will be taken to ensure transparency.



The movement is bigger and more important than any person or candidate and the political party that is born from this movement is only a vehicle for the movement, as far as I am concerned the party can and should dissolve once the movement has completed the goals. All of the wealth and power will be opposed to the movement, so if the chosen candidate of the movement goes down, the torch of the movement must be lifted from the ground before the flame is extinguished. 





  
  
  


Laws and oaths that will be implemented will be listed and explained below in an ongoing and evolving fashion.

  


: Abolition of lobbyists in government 

: No stock or bond purchasing, selling or owning while in federal office

: Any businesses or potential conflict of interest will have to be resolved before the person will be able to serve at a federal level.

: A new and permanent ethics codes and committee to review all federal offices with power to look at all records and documents both financial and personal to ensure that all information is public and that all ethics laws and oaths are being followed

: All candidates elected to federal offices will have to take an oath more similar to the sacrifices of the oath our troops have to take.

: The new oath will include giving the right of the people of America if warranted to investigate all of your business dealing of not only yourself but the people close to you and your family will be subject to investigation even after said person has left office.  

: Reestablish and update the fairness doctrine

: Set strict new laws guiding the ethics for the Supreme Court

Libertarian,1glr2qj,America Wants Who Next As President? (FUNNY post),"""Alright, America, I think I’m finally getting the vibe here:

1. Women leaders? *Nah,* not unless they’re running for the fridge.
2. Political experience? Please, we’re looking for someone who’s barely passed high school civics.
3. Gotta be a white guy? *Big sigh,* but okay.

So, let's cut to the chase. If we’re committed to this, I’ve got a few prime candidates ready to rock this rodeo:

**George Clooney** – Already leads in ‘Best Smile While Holding Coffee,’ and hey, that's 90% of politics, right?  
**Mark Consuelos** – Can handle drama (hello, 'Riverdale') and honestly, wouldn't you rather see him in a State of the Union than...literally anyone else?  
**Bryan Cranston** – If we're going off-script, might as well go with the guy who turned high school chemistry into a billion-dollar empire. 'Breaking Bad' policies? At least we’d be intrigued.  
**Ryan Reynolds** – Yeah, he’s Canadian, but I think we can all agree: he’d make our State Department 10 times more fun and our national holidays...Canadian Thanksgiving.

America, I know you have *big dreams,* but maybe it’s time we finally elect someone who knows the true power of a **really good smirk.** 😎""",0,2024-11-07 09:00:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1glr2qj/america_wants_who_next_as_president_funny_post/

Do any US conservatives support unions as an abstract idea, minimum wage increase, or state healthcare?

Hardline party platforms continue to be baffling to me - I feel like there’s massive opportunity for charismatic candidates to run (and win) while holding stances that will confuse both sides of the classic dem/GOP, left/right, liberal/conservative dichotomies.

I care about:

-Strong border security

-lower taxes for low and middle-income

-minimizing expenditure on foreign wars

-complete overhaul of healthcare system (use our resources to ensure people have the best healthcare in the world)

-less emphasis on culture wars (less emphasis meaning let people do what they want if they’re not hurting others, while not messing with gay marriage)

-legal abortion before the fetus is fully developed 

-gun rights contingent on tests as(more) stringent than those for acquiring a drivers license 

-major increase in federal minimum wage

-ideological support for “labor”, the average citizen, and the ability to fight against corporations

-major focus on education. Not dismantling federal schooling. Increasing expenditure to ensure our citizens are informed and intelligent. Fighting back against the commodification of the bachelors degree, solving the unaffordability of higher education

-complete separation of church and state (this may be a major factor in shifting my stance left- I hate that any policy has religious influence).

Libertarian,1gkk9pv,Today is a Dark Day for Liberty,"Today, as citizens line up to participate in the ritual of voting, a chilling reminder reverberates through the minds of those who value true liberty: the chains of government oppression will remain firmly intact, regardless of who comes out on top. 

It is a dark day, not because of who might win, but because this day is a celebration of a system that thrives on coercion, force, and control. Today is a day that reinforces a disturbing truth--that we have traded genuine freedom for the illusion of choice.

In the grand theater of democracy, we are asked to choose our rulers, yet we are told that we are free. 

But how can true freedom exist within a system that dictates every facet of our lives, from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep? 

Our choices are limited to selecting the next overseer of a sprawling bureaucracy that, despite the slogans and promises, exists to serve itself, funded by the fruits of our labor taken without consent.

Today, every ballot cast is a tacit agreement to the continuation of this system. The state, by its very nature, demands compliance and submission. 

Every law, every regulation, every tax is a reminder that our lives, our choices, and our labor are ultimately at the mercy of others. 

Democracy, though lauded as the epitome of fairness, is merely the tyranny of the majority, a system in which the whims of the many override the rights of the individual.

For those who hold liberty as a sacred principle, the ideal society is not one where we are periodically allowed to choose new masters, but one where we are free to choose for ourselves.

Libertarianism offers an alternative vision--a society based on voluntary interaction, where no one has the right to initiate force against another. 

It is a vision where individuals and communities govern themselves, free from the constraints of an overreaching state.

Today is a dark day, not because of any particular candidate, but because the underlying belief in state power remains unchallenged. 

It is a reminder that, until we reject the chains of the state and embrace a society rooted in voluntary association, we will continue to live in the shadow of tyranny.

And so, we resign ourselves to this darkness, where our lives are parceled out and auctioned off to the highest bidders within government halls. 

Today, we watch as people line up willingly, like sheep to slaughter, voting away their own autonomy in the name of security, stability, and hope. 

We hold no illusions that they will wake up tomorrow with any greater clarity; the machine will grind on, fed by our labor, our property, our very lives. 

Perhaps the bitterest truth of all is that most will never even realize the bars of the cage they so willingly decorate with flags and slogans, their own voices drowning out the faint echoes of freedom they’ve long forgotten.

Our choices are limited to selecting the next overseer of a sprawling bureaucracy that, despite the slogans and promises, exists to serve itself, funded by the fruits of our labor taken without consent.

Today, every ballot cast is a tacit agreement to the continuation of this system. The state, by its very nature, demands compliance and submission. 

Every law, every regulation, every tax is a reminder that our lives, our choices, and our labor are ultimately at the mercy of others. 

Democracy, though lauded as the epitome of fairness, is merely the tyranny of the majority, a system in which the whims of the many override the rights of the individual.

For those who hold liberty as a sacred principle, the ideal society is not one where we are periodically allowed to choose new masters, but one where we are free to choose for ourselves.

Libertarianism offers an alternative vision--a society based on voluntary interaction, where no one has the right to initiate force against another. 

It is a vision where individuals and communities govern themselves, free from the constraints of an overreaching state.

Today is a dark day, not because of any particular candidate, but because the underlying belief in state power remains unchallenged. 

It is a reminder that, until we reject the chains of the state and embrace a society rooted in voluntary association, we will continue to live in the shadow of tyranny.

And so, we resign ourselves to this darkness, where our lives are parceled out and auctioned off to the highest bidders within government halls. 

Today, we watch as people line up willingly, like sheep to slaughter, voting away their own autonomy in the name of security, stability, and hope. 

We hold no illusions that they will wake up tomorrow with any greater clarity; the machine will grind on, fed by our labor, our property, our very lives. 

Perhaps the bitterest truth of all is that most will never even realize the bars of the cage they so willingly decorate with flags and slogans, their own voices drowning out the faint echoes of freedom they’ve long forgotten.

Libertarian,1gkk9pv,Today is a Dark Day for Liberty,"Today, as citizens line up to participate in the ritual of voting, a chilling reminder reverberates through the minds of those who value true liberty: the chains of government oppression will remain firmly intact, regardless of who comes out on top. 

It is a dark day, not because of who might win, but because this day is a celebration of a system that thrives on coercion, force, and control. Today is a day that reinforces a disturbing truth--that we have traded genuine freedom for the illusion of choice.

Libertarian,1gk5yia,You’re Not Apathetic: Preserving Sovereignty by Rejecting the Illusion of Democracy,"Ah, the grand and peculiar theater of democracy, where every individual, in casting a vote, may feel they’re shaping reality – while, in truth, they’re often swallowed by it. Your steadfast refusal to vote, then, becomes not mere apathy but a philosophical stance, a rejection of participation in what you perceive as an elaborate charade.

In essence, you’re choosing to retain sovereignty over your perception of reality. To cast a vote would be, as you see it, a betrayal of that sovereignty, an act of legitimizing a system that functions more as a conveyor of others’ wills than as a mirror of the people’s collective vision. The democratic ideal – that each vote builds a grand mosaic of collective intent – presupposes conditions of transparency, accountability, and genuine influence, the absence of which, as you’ve observed, renders the act largely symbolic.

By not voting, you avoid surrendering to the reality imposed by those who champion the system as a beacon of freedom. You see through the mechanism, recognizing that elections often serve to reinforce a particular narrative rather than to derive a genuine, unified will. Instead of validating that narrative, you reject it outright, refusing to let your voice be a note in a song you didn’t choose to sing.

In a way, your stance could be seen as a kind of civic duty in itself – a commitment to preserving personal integrity and clear-eyed observation over conformity to a distorted collective ritual. Rather than participating in what might feel like a hollow affirmation of the “will of the people,” you assert a different truth: that to participate would be to tacitly endorse a system that, by its current nature, rarely delivers the ideal it claims to uphold.

It’s a complex form of protest, a refusal that demands nothing, seeks no recognition, and yet quietly resists the machinery that would reduce individuals to mere cogs in a grander apparatus. Instead of engaging in the futile act of casting a vote, you stand firm in your conviction, embodying an alternative form of dissent that speaks volumes without a single mark on a ballot.",3,2024-11-05 07:52:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1gk5yia/youre_not_apathetic_preserving_sovereignty_by/

Libertarian,1giutmc,Thoughts on CA Prop 6?,"
Really struggling with this one. On one hand, I am against state coercion and my guy instinct is to vote yes, but on the other hand, convicts consent to the punishment laid out when they decide to break the law, so that kind of undermines the state coercion aspect. I’m also concerned about the financial impact. What if a large amount of convicts refuse to work and we have to pay for people to do the jobs the convicts aren’t interested in doing?

Anyway, I would appreciate everyone’s thoughts on this, both for and against. I looked up LPCA’s stance on it to help me make a decision, but they have it as pending review (probably having the same issues deciding), so I figured I’d ask the libertarian community at large. Like I said, I’m leaning toward yes, but can definitely be persuaded to go no.

Really struggling with this one. On one hand, I am against state coercion and my guy instinct is to vote yes, but on the other hand, convicts consent to the punishment laid out when they decide to break the law, so that kind of undermines the state coercion aspect. I’m also concerned about the financial impact. What if a large amount of convicts refuse to work and we have to pay for people to do the jobs the convicts aren’t interested in doing?

Libertarian,1gh4u5q,Common leftist talking points and some responses to them.,"**1. Sweden is socialist and therefore, socialism is successful**

This argument is easy to debunk. Sweden used to have a regulated economy but when they added universal healthcare and high taxation, their economy froze and they had to completely deregulate it. Imo if it's actually pretty Libertarian in terms of economics but in terms of government, it's kinda big.

**2. Communism only failed because Capitalists sabotaged by not trading with them**

Socialist countries are not entitled to the fruits of Capitalism. If you want Capitalists to invest in your country, don't scare them by stealing their property and pretty much making it unprofitable to make business in it. Capitalist countries are not obligated to empower the economies of people who would steal their property, murder them and ruin their nation. Also, most countries want to trade with successful countries, not commie disasters.

**3. Soviet Union and China are State Capitalists not Socialists**

This talking point is partially true with China. They did have a tiny bit of liberalization but does a tiny bit of freedom completely undermine total control of the economy by the state? Also, the only reason why China has any influence is from the liberalization, their economy was shit before it.

**4. McCarthy is evil**

This painting of McCarthy as some sort of demonic entity by socialists is in fact, historical revisionism. McCarthy prosecuted Hollywood for communists and.... guess what... he was right... It was filled to the brim with socialists, commies and more of the like. He made them snitch on each other. I think they're trying to make people ignore the fact he was correct and most of the people he prosecuted were in fact, commies and spies. I think it's so that people view commies as victims and ignore their danger.",0,2024-11-01 09:02:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1gh4u5q/common_leftist_talking_points_and_some_responses/

This painting of McCarthy as some sort of demonic entity by socialists is in fact, historical revisionism. McCarthy prosecuted Hollywood for communists and.... guess what... he was right...

Libertarian,1gh4u5q,Common leftist talking points and some responses to them.,"**1. Sweden is socialist and therefore, socialism is successful**

This argument is easy to debunk. Sweden used to have a regulated economy but when they added universal healthcare and high taxation, their economy froze and they had to completely deregulate it. Imo if it's actually pretty Libertarian in terms of economics but in terms of government, it's kinda big.

**2. Communism only failed because Capitalists sabotaged by not trading with them**

Socialist countries are not entitled to the fruits of Capitalism. If you want Capitalists to invest in your country, don't scare them by stealing their property and pretty much making it unprofitable to make business in it. Capitalist countries are not obligated to empower the economies of people who would steal their property, murder them and ruin their nation. Also, most countries want to trade with successful countries, not commie disasters.

**3. Soviet Union and China are State Capitalists not Socialists**

This talking point is partially true with China. They did have a tiny bit of liberalization but does a tiny bit of freedom completely undermine total control of the economy by the state? Also, the only reason why China has any influence is from the liberalization, their economy was shit before it.

Libertarian,1gh4u5q,Common leftist talking points and some responses to them.,"**1. Sweden is socialist and therefore, socialism is successful**

This argument is easy to debunk. Sweden used to have a regulated economy but when they added universal healthcare and high taxation, their economy froze and they had to completely deregulate it. Imo if it's actually pretty Libertarian in terms of economics but in terms of government, it's kinda big.

**2. Communism only failed because Capitalists sabotaged by not trading with them**

Socialist countries are not entitled to the fruits of Capitalism. If you want Capitalists to invest in your country, don't scare them by stealing their property and pretty much making it unprofitable to make business in it. Capitalist countries are not obligated to empower the economies of people who would steal their property, murder them and ruin their nation. Also, most countries want to trade with successful countries, not commie disasters.

**3. Soviet Union and China are State Capitalists not Socialists**

This talking point is partially true with China. They did have a tiny bit of liberalization but does a tiny bit of freedom completely undermine total control of the economy by the state? Also, the only reason why China has any influence is from the liberalization, their economy was shit before it.

**4. McCarthy is evil**

This painting of McCarthy as some sort of demonic entity by socialists is in fact, historical revisionism. McCarthy prosecuted Hollywood for communists and.... guess what... he was right... It was filled to the brim with socialists, commies and more of the like. He made them snitch on each other.

Libertarian,1gbjneq,What is your take on government workers who trespass for “good” causes/,My brother works for a local government agency or rather a private business that is contracted through the county. They are a mesquito pest control company. They don’t charge money or sell anything to anyone. Their money is entirely funded through the county. They do an arguably great job of maintaining mesquito population controls. Mosquitos are obviously one of the largest spreaders of disease in our time. Their work is arguably a good thing. However he recently told me he is allowed to enter any property (not the house) if they suspect mosquitos or harbor larvae spawning pits without permission from the property owner. How does libertarianism feel about this? What are y’all’s thoughts?,15,2024-10-24 22:11:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1gbjneq/what_is_your_take_on_government_workers_who/

Libertarian,1g6uw3f,Minarchist conflicted with other Minarchists,I take a more pragmatic approach for the economy. I think it’s moronic to abolish wage standards and just watch what happens. I know exactly what will happen. Corporations will take advantage of it immediately and hire workers at the lowest costs. Poverty will also increase exponentially. I’ll never support abolishing wage standards above $8 an hour. It seems more reasonable to abolish taxation completely. Nobody except maybe immigrants is going to work for less than $8 an hour. I support the people of each individual state voluntarily deciding on a minimum wage over just abolishing it. States should have zero control on this issue and should only be allowed to suggest and ask what the people want and make it happen once they’re heard. I believe that the state should only be responsible for essential services and even some of those at a minimal level.,0,2024-10-18 18:48:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1g6uw3f/minarchist_conflicted_with_other_minarchists/

Libertarian,1g27r3w,What is the second most ideal form of social order from an anarcho-capitalist perspective?,"I am convinced that an anarcho-capitalist social order is the best form of social order. So who do you think the silver medal should go to?

 I think classical liberalism in the narrow sense has proven itself to be an unstable form of government. Look at the history of some examples of classical liberalism, such as the United States and 19th-century Britain. The Ratchet effect is a terrifying thing. The state tends to grow, and democracy constantly expands the state due to pressure and interest groups. At the end of this process, states similar to social democratic states are formed. Even though they have obnoxious things like minimum wages, labor regulations and a welfare state, the only democratic-post-democratic states that don't have to deal with things like high taxes and import bans are tax haven microstates like San Marino. 

Such microstates are under great pressure to implement a freer market, but this certainly does not mean that every microstate will have a good free market. Consider countries like Tuvalu, which has a Freedom House score of 93 but a per capita income of only $4091. This country's population is 12- Around 13 thousand people. I can give many other similar examples; São Tomé and Príncipe or Comoros etc.

I think being decentralized is very important for the management model that will receive the silver medal, but this is not enough. For this very reason, I give the silver medal to Yarvin's Neocameralist city-states. I think a city-state that is run by shareholders like a company and whose shares are listed on the stock market is the second best thing we can have. 

Even in Europe, proto-neocameralist states like Monaco or Liechtenstein outperform their fully democratic-post-democratic neighbors like SanMarino. What do you think? What is the second best social order in terms of criteria such as stability of the political model, respect for people's natural rights, and creation of wealth?",19,2024-10-12 15:25:30,https://i.redd.it/vvq6k5xemdud1.jpeg

Consider countries like Tuvalu, which has a Freedom House score of 93 but a per capita income of only $4091. This country's population is 12- Around 13 thousand people. I can give many other similar examples; São Tomé and Príncipe or Comoros etc.

I think being decentralized is very important for the management model that will receive the silver medal, but this is not enough. For this very reason, I give the silver medal to Yarvin's Neocameralist city-states. I think a city-state that is run by shareholders like a company and whose shares are listed on the stock market is the second best thing we can have. 

Even in Europe, proto-neocameralist states like Monaco or Liechtenstein outperform their fully democratic-post-democratic neighbors like SanMarino. What do you think? What is the second best social order in terms of criteria such as stability of the political model, respect for people's natural rights, and creation of wealth?",19,2024-10-12 15:25:30,https://i.redd.it/vvq6k5xemdud1.jpeg
Libertarian,1g27r3w,What is the second most ideal form of social order from an anarcho-capitalist perspective?,"I am convinced that an anarcho-capitalist social order is the best form of social order. So who do you think the silver medal should go to?

 I think classical liberalism in the narrow sense has proven itself to be an unstable form of government. Look at the history of some examples of classical liberalism, such as the United States and 19th-century Britain. The Ratchet effect is a terrifying thing. The state tends to grow, and democracy constantly expands the state due to pressure and interest groups. At the end of this process, states similar to social democratic states are formed. Even though they have obnoxious things like minimum wages, labor regulations and a welfare state, the only democratic-post-democratic states that don't have to deal with things like high taxes and import bans are tax haven microstates like San Marino.

Libertarian,1g0pbfw,Property rights in modern times,"So I started reading *For A New Liberty* and I got into part 2 of the creed when it's talking about the Lockean views of property rights: Fruits of your labor, etc.

I get what the author is saying about property rights but say in today's world, we can barter with things of value for a product or service (a pig, money, a car, what have you). But, how you go about securing land property into your name? You have a deed which ""proves ownership"" of the house and accompanying land right? 

I did see someone wrote about using essentially contracts as a proof of ownership, which I believe could be receipts for goods, titles to cars, deeds to land, etc. 

I've considered myself, viewpoint wise, a libertarian but I've never deeply read into it until recently. Tell me what I'm missing, your thoughts, if I'm far off from the main point or what. I just want to make sure I have a good grasp of the varying viewpoints of property rights when it comes to material goods

Libertarian,1fvv4in,Looking for feedback on a theory on money's origin that requires absolutely no government and no trust and no agreement among people.,"Hi all, I'm in the behavioral sciences, my work has been cited, covered, taught in a few places. But I'm not an economist and I don't know any economists, so I am interested in getting feedback here.

I observed something a few years ago that I thought applied to how money seems to work, and after focusing on it for a bit, I realized it forms a theory that is outside of the idea that money's value comes from government, or from trust or coerced agreements (which I always thought were unsatisfying explanations) or even from its usefulness as money (since that doesn't explain why the first person wanted gold, rare feathers etc before anyone else knew it or wanted to trade for it). Anyway it looks like this...

1. Early humans collected unfamiliar and scarce items, since those items could turn out to be potentially useful, in the same way we keep knick-knack drawers in our houses today.
2. People who went outside the known territory had more of these items than others. Because these people went to more dangerous areas and survived, they tended to be more capable than normal (even if you take the item from its owner via treachery, you still often had to be clever, tough etc). Likewise, the scarce items they kept sometimes did turn out to be more useful, like stones that make sharper weapons. Because of these two factors, people who collected scarce items had a survival advantage.
3. At the same time, these people who had the scarce items and the survival advantage also had allies or mates. And because those allies and mates were around someone who was more capable than normal, and that person also had items that sometimes were more useful than normal, those allies and mates survived more often over time also.
4. Because of this group survival advantage, people eventually evolved a desire to be around other people who had lots of scarce items, provided that they knew the items were scarce. Likewise, people evolved a desire to find and keep scarce items themselves, and to display those items since it helped them find allies and mates.
5. People who had these desired items would sometimes give some of them to their allies and mates so their allies and mates could benefit more from them, in the same way that some Native American tribes give eagle feathers to each other as gifts.
6. Over time, some of these items happened to be recognizable, durable, evenly divisible, or easily transferable, so they were the most reliable signs of fitness, or could be displayed for a long time, or could represent smaller amounts of value, or were more easy to give to others. The items with the most of these traits got traded around the most often, in exchange for things, and became what we call money.

So, because there's real survival advantages involved the whole way, our instincts have a real basis. No one has to ""print money"" or enforce its value with police. But likewise, money doesn't have a practical use (it has reputational value), we don't need to all trust in the value of money or coerce any form of agreement out of each other (the instinct to value scarce items evolves naturally regardless of our opinion), and we don't even need to think that money has to be glittery or pretty (bitcoin of course has no appearance at all but is hugely valuable due to its hard scarcity, which fits).

Anyway you guys seem to know a lot about money here and I thought someone might be interested in helping me shore this up and see what else I might need to address. I've written a couple preprints on it, I think it does a good job of providing an actual solid basis for money as a natural phenomenon without systems or coercion. Any feedback is appreciated, I'm looking into publishing this one if it turns out well.",8,2024-10-04 05:31:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1fvv4in/looking_for_feedback_on_a_theory_on_moneys_origin/

Libertarian,1fuu871,Some questions from non-libertarian. ,"Libertarianism(minarchism) for me seems actually pretty nice from what i've read, but I still have some questions about it.

1. How would private courts would function? Or will that be governments job after all? For me it seems that both private courts and government courts still have risks of becoming corrupt for profit. 

2. How would road system work? It seems to me that private road system would be very hard because of poor coordination between companies. Having to pay for multiple roads also is an inconvenince.

3. How would postal service work? 

Because of lack of answers to these questions or my inability to find them, for me a preferred political/economic system is social democracy or something like switzerland that has direct democracy, good welfare, great civil liberties, low corruption and decently free market.

2. How would road system work? It seems to me that private road system would be very hard because of poor coordination between companies. Having to pay for multiple roads also is an inconvenince.

3. How would postal service work? 

Because of lack of answers to these questions or my inability to find them, for me a preferred political/economic system is social democracy or something like switzerland that has direct democracy, good welfare, great civil liberties, low corruption and decently free market.

Ask_Politics,1gzl991,Is the US taking in too many immigrants? ,"There are generally 2 big camps in the immigration debate, those who believe it should be laxer to promote the movement of people and capital and to reduce illegal immigration through such means.

On the other side there are people who believe it should stay as is or become stricter, because the US could get flooded by millions of foreigners because it's so desirable and the country allegedly cannot support it.

So my question is, can't it? The US does take in the most immigrants per year, but not per capita, not by far, it actually only takes the fraction of a percent of its population via legal immigration per year. It's also not extensively a welfare state as some european states are, and currently unemployment is low and theres a high demand for low skill labor.

Is the US actually suffering from high influx of immigration? Are immigrants a drain on the economy or net contributors? What are some negatives that have arisen from immigration?",0,2024-11-25 10:21:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1gzl991/is_the_us_taking_in_too_many_immigrants/

Ask_Politics,1gzl991,Is the US taking in too many immigrants? ,"There are generally 2 big camps in the immigration debate, those who believe it should be laxer to promote the movement of people and capital and to reduce illegal immigration through such means.

On the other side there are people who believe it should stay as is or become stricter, because the US could get flooded by millions of foreigners because it's so desirable and the country allegedly cannot support it.

So my question is, can't it? The US does take in the most immigrants per year, but not per capita, not by far, it actually only takes the fraction of a percent of its population via legal immigration per year. It's also not extensively a welfare state as some european states are, and currently unemployment is low and theres a high demand for low skill labor.

Ask_Politics,1gpwncg,Do you think Bernie was right about the election loss?,"I’ll start by saying I completely agree with Bernie. This has been one of my main criticisms of the Democratic Party for a while.

Trump didn’t win as much as the Democrats lost. They lost voters because they aren’t the party of the people anymore. We used to have Republicans who stood for big business and Democrats who represented the people. The left is the reason we have a 40-hour work week, disability benefits, a middle class, Social Security, Medicare, labor unions, child labor laws, environmental protections, civil rights laws, workplace safety standards, unemployment insurance, and affordable healthcare reforms. These are just a few of the changes that have shaped the country for the better.

Since the Clinton administration, the Democrats have been co-opted by big business, adopting policies rooted in Reaganomics. As a result, the middle class has continued to shrink under every president since, while wealth concentrates at the top. When the Democrats do fight for people, it’s minimal, and their victories no longer feel significant, as they once did. This shift is largely due to the influence of campaign financing, particularly after key decisions like Buckley v. Valeo (1976), which equated money with free speech, and Citizens United v. FEC (2010), which allowed unlimited corporate spending on elections. These rulings opened the floodgates for dark money and Super PACs, making it easier for corporations and wealthy individuals to exert massive influence over elections and policy. Both parties are bought and paid for by corporate interests. We've essentially legalized bribes, creating a corrupt democracy where policy is driven by money rather than the will of the people.

We need a party that represents the working class. Sadly, we no longer have that.",38,2024-11-12 16:54:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1gpwncg/do_you_think_bernie_was_right_about_the_election/
Ask_Politics,1gpubmq,What’s to stop individual US states from pursuing universal healthcare via interstate agreements?,"
I live in New England; specifically, Vermont. Universal healthcare is a **hugely** popular policy goal in the northeast (with *maybe* the exception of NH, but don’t quote me on that).

In Vermont, the skyrocketing cost of healthcare/health insurance has snowballed into an array of other crises, notably one in education. Keeping our full-time ed workers covered by health insurance has become an enormously difficult task, and since our school systems are funded by local property taxes, that means homeowners are seeing close to 15-20% increases in property taxes each year. There are somewhat more complex issues here, but healthcare is definitely a big one. And while I’d love to just say “VT should just provide universal healthcare,” our small population & revenue base makes that exceedingly difficult. 

Now I grew up in Massachusetts, which as far as I’ve seen has shown huge success with “Romneycare,” basically state-provided Medicaid. 

So what I’m wondering is: what’s stopping my state’s governor/legislature from reaching out to MA and negotiating a way to hop in on their plan? I understand there could be difficulties selling such a plan *politically*, I’m just wondering what logistical/legal hurdles, if any, are keeping this from happening?",5,2024-11-12 15:17:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1gpubmq/whats_to_stop_individual_us_states_from_pursuing/

I live in New England; specifically, Vermont. Universal healthcare is a **hugely** popular policy goal in the northeast (with *maybe* the exception of NH, but don’t quote me on that).

In Vermont, the skyrocketing cost of healthcare/health insurance has snowballed into an array of other crises, notably one in education. Keeping our full-time ed workers covered by health insurance has become an enormously difficult task, and since our school systems are funded by local property taxes, that means homeowners are seeing close to 15-20% increases in property taxes each year. There are somewhat more complex issues here, but healthcare is definitely a big one.

Ask_Politics,1glhzp9,Why Didn’t Kamala Harris Highlight Local Infrastructure Projects in Her 2024 Campaign?,"I noticed that in her 2024 presidential campaign, Kamala Harris talked a lot about broad issues like healthcare, and economic policy. But I didn’t hear much about specific, local infrastructure projects funded by recent federal acts—like the Fort Jenkins and Water Street bridge replacements in Pennsylvania or similar projects in other states.

Given that these kinds of projects have direct impacts on local communities (improving safety, creating jobs, boosting local economies), I would think highlighting them could help connect with voters by showing tangible results from signature policies from the Biden / Harris administration. Why might her campaign (or any national campaign) avoid promoting specific local projects? Is there a strategic reason for focusing on broader issues rather than pointing to real, visible projects on the ground? Or would mentioning these local wins be more effective in connecting with voters?

Ask_Politics,1fdahn3,One thing I don't understand about the Bush administration's decisions is why they would empower the Shiite majority in Iraq instead of the Sunnis during the U.S. invasion of Iraq,"Alright, let state things before I ask this question. I am trying to understand why and how of everything that lead to US invasion of iraq and the disaster that came with it. From oil, to neo conservative actually caring for Democracy but no ideas how to do it, from bush administration relying on Iraqi exiled who don't know anything about current iraq in 2002, to disband the Iraqi army and not enough US soldiers in Iraq to keep things in orders. 
But one things that really got me is De-Ba'athification and usa actually increased the power of shiite in Iraq. But seriously did George W Bush forgot that Iranian are shiite? and shiite do favor Iran than other sunni countries and even the USA itself. So you are telling me that none of whole experts told bush or Paul bremer about the inevitable iran influence?
Bush himself called Iran as one the Axis of evil. Another thing to consider is that De-Ba'athification is often compared to Denazification, but anyone who had to join the Ba'ath Party just to get a job (as was required under Saddam's regime) could no longer hold that job after the U.S. invasion. Meanwhile, a former chief of staff under Hitler, Adolf Heusinger, became a NATO leader. I guess my whole question can be summarized as: Did George W. Bush have any plan for Iran in Iraq, or was he just too pissy about his dad almost being assassinated a decade ago in 2002?",11,2024-09-10 01:26:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/1fdahn3/one_thing_i_dont_understand_about_the_bush/

Ask_Politics,1ekhkfx,"What is the “border crisis”, and why is it of concern?","I’m not very well versed/educated on this topic, and trying to understand more. I keep hearing around social media of these open borders and how millions of illegal immigrants are entering the country, committing crimes, stealing jobs etc. (which of course is social media, so I don’t know the validity to much of what I’m seeing/reading). I have a few questions that I’m trying to get clarified.

Are open borders a bad thing? From my understanding, open borders doesn’t mean without border patrol/policing. Why would a more progressive person support softer border policies, and why are conservatives so against it? 

Is this supposed “border crisis” something that has gotten worse with the Biden’s presidency, or is it something that conservatives are trying to paint as propaganda for campaign reasons? Did Biden end border policies that would otherwise be considered “good”?

Should there be stricter border policies? Just assuming there is a ceiling to the amount of people crossing that the US can absorb without devoting proper resources to them.

Ask_Politics,1e0yi10,Why is the White House so soft on India?,"I recently saw a news article where NATO has labeled China an enabler of war.  That’s definitely a bit concerning but probably an apt label since they have favored their Russian trading partners to their own benefit.

But I have got to ask the question:

Why is the White House so soft on India.  I mean they have blatantly not only continued to trade with Russia but also increased imports of oil since the very beginning of the conflict.  Yet Biden has only seemed to get cozier and cozier with Modhi.  I also read the joint statement from India and US by the White House.  Needless to say it is a bit concerning.  From a labor standpoint I am not convinced a close partnership with India will benefit the US, as I have seen the tech layoffs only increase since the pandemic- under the guise of AI.  See Deloitte’s tremendous offshoring efforts.  

So why so soft and favorable to India?

Ask_Politics,1dzjobw,Is this socialism?,"Background: I live in a very small town in Illinois. Let's get this detail taken care of first, it's a long hard drive to get to Chicago. The town is organized as a ""city"" and that's how I will refer to it going forward. Also, the trash company I will be referring to operates out of a neighboring county. 

The city government subcontracts with the trash company who provides curbside weekly pickup with provided containers. The charge for this ""service"" is on an entity's/resident's water bill. The line item is 17.50/month. Additionally, the city requested the trash service provide 8 large dumpsters on city owned property, and offered to allow county residents deposit their trash in these extra dumpsters for 17.50/month. 

Unfortunately the dumpsters where placed in a highly visible location on city property amongst downtown businesses and residences. There is no access card system set up and no fence. It is unsightly, incredibly messy, invites animals, and generally abused. There is no way to prove the abuse, since there are no access cards however it must be assumed, since, you know, human nature....

City Council meetings have been spicy! fiery! The most exciting thing around! The City Clerk (elected, non-partisan position) is adamant that the dumpsters stay where they are. He also claims that the dumpsters ""make"" the city 50,000/year. However, after 3 fun meetings, it's up to 65,000.

The line item is 17.50/month. Additionally, the city requested the trash service provide 8 large dumpsters on city owned property, and offered to allow county residents deposit their trash in these extra dumpsters for 17.50/month. 

Unfortunately the dumpsters where placed in a highly visible location on city property amongst downtown businesses and residences. There is no access card system set up and no fence. It is unsightly, incredibly messy, invites animals, and generally abused. There is no way to prove the abuse, since there are no access cards however it must be assumed, since, you know, human nature....

City Council meetings have been spicy! fiery! The most exciting thing around! The City Clerk (elected, non-partisan position) is adamant that the dumpsters stay where they are. He also claims that the dumpsters ""make"" the city 50,000/year. However, after 3 fun meetings, it's up to 65,000.

Make? Bad choice of words?

Is it governments job to ""make"" - which I understand as generating a profit, money? 

There is no question the city should be covering administrative costs, to include, direct and indirect costs that the city accrues. But he is now claiming this money covers his salary, the water clerk/treasurers salary, and a maintenance persons salary. ( Don't do the math, it's pretty ovbious, Do all three of them get food stamps you ask....?)

Let's get into the meat of this issue. Government's job is to set up and maintain basic services to keep society functioning in a healthy, safe, pleasant, even beautiful environmnet. The better educated, the more opportunities, the happier, calmer, little societal unrest, capitolism is profitably conducted when the greater good has been provided for first. But, is it the governments responsibility to create income (revenue-expenses=income) for itself. 

What next, a toilet paper company? Can government subcontract out with kimberly clark and put it on your water bill and deliver toilet paper on a weekly basis. Isn't that socialism or something?

Ask_Politics,1dkmv3r,Looking for career advice in an election year,"So I (24F) am in the final interview stage for 2 different Democratic jobs, both of which I would consider a dream job. I know it’s FAR from a guarantee that I will get offered either job, let alone both, however, I want to be prepared in case I do get offered both because I will likely have a very short window of time to decide if I do get an offer.  

Job A is at a national political organization and would end Nov 15. It would be a great opportunity to develop professional connections more nationally and would give me a wider range of skills in my chosen field. I had the final interview yesterday and they just asked for my references. 

Job B is with one of the few members of Congress whose platform aligns with my values almost completely and it’s exactly the type of job I would be looking for if this weren’t an election year. From what I’ve seen, it’s rare to find a hill opening for a rep that shares your values, and even rarer to find a position with them that’s exactly the type of job you want to do. I would also have more job security here because it doesn’t end after the election in November (the rep is in a VERY safe blue seat). I know that the hill will be there after the election, but this job, and others like it, likely won’t be/there will be a lot more competition after everyone working the election gets laid off. I interviewed with them on Monday and they said they’d be in contact with me “shortly” and that they’re “looking to finalize everything by the start of July.”

Questions: 
1. Would I be missing out by not taking a campaign job? (I did organizing work on a campaign in 2020 so I’m not totally without campaign experience) 
2. What else should I be considering when weighing my options?

1. Would I be missing out by not taking a campaign job? (I did organizing work on a campaign in 2020 so I’m not totally without campaign experience) 
2. What else should I be considering when weighing my options?

Job A is at a national political organization and would end Nov 15. It would be a great opportunity to develop professional connections more nationally and would give me a wider range of skills in my chosen field. I had the final interview yesterday and they just asked for my references. 

Job B is with one of the few members of Congress whose platform aligns with my values almost completely and it’s exactly the type of job I would be looking for if this weren’t an election year. From what I’ve seen, it’s rare to find a hill opening for a rep that shares your values, and even rarer to find a position with them that’s exactly the type of job you want to do. I would also have more job security here because it doesn’t end after the election in November (the rep is in a VERY safe blue seat).

2. What else should I be considering when weighing my options?

Ask_Politics,1dkmv3r,Looking for career advice in an election year,"So I (24F) am in the final interview stage for 2 different Democratic jobs, both of which I would consider a dream job. I know it’s FAR from a guarantee that I will get offered either job, let alone both, however, I want to be prepared in case I do get offered both because I will likely have a very short window of time to decide if I do get an offer.  

Job A is at a national political organization and would end Nov 15. It would be a great opportunity to develop professional connections more nationally and would give me a wider range of skills in my chosen field. I had the final interview yesterday and they just asked for my references. 

Job B is with one of the few members of Congress whose platform aligns with my values almost completely and it’s exactly the type of job I would be looking for if this weren’t an election year. From what I’ve seen, it’s rare to find a hill opening for a rep that shares your values, and even rarer to find a position with them that’s exactly the type of job you want to do. I would also have more job security here because it doesn’t end after the election in November (the rep is in a VERY safe blue seat). I know that the hill will be there after the election, but this job, and others like it, likely won’t be/there will be a lot more competition after everyone working the election gets laid off. I interviewed with them on Monday and they said they’d be in contact with me “shortly” and that they’re “looking to finalize everything by the start of July.”
